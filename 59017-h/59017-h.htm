<p class="in0">Messrs <span class="smcap">Blackwood and Sons</span>,
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,—Scarcely arrived in London, on my annual visit to this
capital, a fiend put into my hands a copy of Blackwood’s Edinburgh
Magazine for June 1846, in which I observe an article entitled “<i>Rogues in
Outline</i>.” The writer of this article, in a section headed “<i>Birbone—Baseggio</i>,”
has taken most unwarrantable liberties with my character, mixing them up
with some false details respecting my private life. The latter impertinences I
treat with contempt: not so the titles applied to me of “<i>Old Rogue B——</i>”
and “<i>Birbone Baseggio</i>,” with the insinuation that I make a practice of
selling modern objects for antiques.</p>

<p>If your correspondent had taken the trouble to inquire of any of his <em>well-informed</em>
countrymen at Rome or in England, he certainly never would have
committed you, or himself, by the publication of the calumny he so wantonly
seeks to inflict on my character. Luckily for me, there are now here many
respectable persons of rank and reputation who will take a pleasure in attesting,
<em>if necessary</em>, the habitual fairness and straight-forwardness of my dealings.
I expect equal fairness from you, and that you will lose no time in
affording me the reparation of a wrong you have (I trust unconsciously) done
me, by at least publishing this letter in your next Number, giving me in the
mean time an assurance to that effect. I await your answer, and remain your
obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sigright larger">
JOSEPH BASEGGIO.

<h2 id="MEXICO" class="nobreak">MEXICO, ITS TERRITORY AND PEOPLE.</h2>

<p>Man must be content to follow the
steps of Providence tardily, timidly,
and uncertainly; but he can have no
pursuit more worthy of his genius, his
wisdom, or his virtue. Why one half
of the globe remained hidden from the
other during the four or five thousand
years after its creation, is among the
questions which we may long ask
without obtaining an answer. Why
the treasures, the plants, and the animals
of America should have been
utterly unknown, alike to the adventurous
expeditions of Tyre and Sidon,
to the nautical skill of the Carthaginian,
to the brilliant curiosity of the
Greek, and to the imperial ambition
of the Roman; while their discovery
was reserved for a Genoese sailor in
the fifteenth century, is a problem
perhaps inaccessible of solution by any
human insight into the ways of the
Great Disposer of all things. Yet
may it not be conjectured that the
knowledge was expressly withheld
until it could be of practical use to
mankind; that if America had been
discovered a thousand years before, it
would have been found only a vast
wilderness in both its southern and
northern divisions, for it was then
almost wholly unpeopled; that with
the chief interest of imperial Rome
turned to European possession or
Eastern conquest, the discovery would
have been nearly thrown away; that
there was hitherto no superflux of
European population to pour into this
magnificent desert; and that even if
Roman adventure had dared the terrors
of the ocean, and the perils of
new climates, at an almost interminable
distance from home, the massacres
and plunders habitual to heathen
conquest must have impeded, if
not wholly broken up, the progress of
the feeble population already settling
on the soil; or perhaps trained that
population to habits of ferocity like
their own, and turned a peaceful and
pastoral land into a scene of slaughter
and misery?</p>

<p>The discovery of the American Continent
flashed on the world like the
discovery of a new Creation. In reading
the correspondence of the learned
at the time, the return of Columbus,
and the knowledge which that return
brought, is spoken of with a rapture
of language more resembling an Arabian
tale than the narrative of the
most adventurous voyage of man.
The primitive races of their fellow-beings,
living in the simplicity of nature,
under forests of the palm, with
all delicious fruits for their food, with
gold and pearls for their toys, and
the rich treasures of new plants and
animals of all species for their indulgence
and their use, were described
with the astonishment and delight of
a dream of Fairy-land, or the still
richer visions of restored Paradise.</p>

<p>Yet, when the hues of imagination
grew colourless by time, the continents
of the West displayed to the
ripened knowledge of Europe virtues
only still more substantial. The contrast
between the northern and southern
portions of the New World is of
the most striking kind. It is scarcely
less marked than the distinction between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the broken, deeply-divided, and
well-watered surface of Europe, and
the broad plains, vast mountain
ranges, and few, but mighty rivers,
which form the characteristic features
of Asia. In North America, we see
a land of singularly varied surface, in
its primitive state, covered with forest;
with an uncertain climate; a
soil seldom luxuriant, often sterile,
every where requiring, and generally
rewarding human industry; watered
by many rivers, penetrated in almost
every direction by navigable streams,
and traversed from north to south, an
unusual direction for rivers, by an immense
stream, the Mississippi, bringing
down the furs, the produce of the
north, the corn of the temperate zone,
the fruits of the tropics, and connecting
all those regions with the commerce
of Europe: a natural canal, of more
than two thousand miles, without a
perceptible difference of breadth, from
New Orleans to the falls of St Anthony.
The Arkansas, Missouri, Ohio,
noble rivers, traverse the land in a
variety of directions, with courses of
from fifteen hundred to two thousand
miles; and to the north of the United
States, a chain of vast inland seas, a
succession of Mediterraneans, surrounded
by productive provinces, rapidly
filling with a busy population.</p>

<p>The southern portion of the New
World exhibits the plains of Tartary,
the solitary mountain range of India,
the fertility of the Asiatic soil. It, too,
has its Ganges and its Indus, in the
Amazon and the Rio de la Plata; but
its smaller streams are few and feeble.
It has the fiery heat of India, the dangerous
exhalations of the jungle, the
tiger and the lion, though of a less
daring and powerful species; and the
native, dark, delicate, timid, and indolent,
as the Hindoo.</p>

<p>Without speaking of the contrast as
perfectly sustained in all its points,
it is unquestionable that North and
South America have been formed for
two great families of humankind as distinct
as energy and ease; that the
North is to be possessed only as the
conquest of toil, while the South allows
of the languor into whose hand the
fruit drops from the tree.</p>

<p>May it not also be rationally conjectured,
that in the discovery Europe
and America were equally the objects
of the Providential benevolence? It
was palpably the Divine will to give
Europe a new and powerful advance
in the fifteenth century. Printing,
gunpowder, and the mariner’s compass,
were its gifts to Europe; to be followed
and consummated in that new
impulse at once to religious truth and
to social improvement, which so soon
transpired in the German Reformation,
and in the commercial system of England
and the continental nations. The
extension of this mighty impulse to
America rapidly followed. The first
English colony was planted in North
America in the reign of Elizabeth, the
great protectress of Protestantism;
and the first authentic knowledge of
South America was brought to Europe
by the discoveries of Englishmen, following
the route of Columbus, and
going beyond him. It is true that the
intercourse of the South with the energetic
qualities and free principles of
Europe was impeded by an influence
which, from its first being, has been hostile
to the free progress of the human
mind. The Popedom threw its shadow
over Spanish America, and the great
experiment of civilisation was comparatively
thrown away wherever the
priest of Rome was paramount. The
land, too, witnessed a succession of
slaughters, and the still more fearful
trade in the unfortunate natives of
Africa. But the most powerful contrast
was furnished to mankind in the
rapid growth of the Protestant states
of the north, in their increasing commerce,
in the vigour of their laws, in
the activity of the public mind, and
the ascent of their scattered and feeble
communities into the rank and the
enjoyments of a great nation.</p>

<p>Nor are we to speak of South America
as having wholly slept during the
period since its discovery. If all the
larger faculties which give nations a
place in history remained in a state of
collapse under the pressure of Spain,
society had made a forward step in
every province of that great territory.
The inhabitants had never relapsed
into their primitive barbarism; they
had laws, commerce, manufactures,
and literature, all in a ruder degree
than as developed under the
vivid activity of Europe, but all
raising the provinces into a gradual
capacity of social vigour, of popular
civilisation, and perhaps even of that
pure religion without which national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
power is only national evil. Perhaps
the cloud which has rested for so many
ages over the moral soil of South America,
may have been suffered to remain
until the soil itself acquired strength
for a larger product under a more
industrious generation. It is not improbable
that as the gold and silver of
the South were evidently developed,
in the fifteenth century, to supply the
new commercial impulse of that time
of European advance, the still more
copious, and still more important,
agricultural wealth of countries overflowing
with unused exuberance—the
magnificent tropical fertility of the continents
beyond the ocean—may have
been reserved to increase the opulence
and stimulate the ardour of a period
which the Steam-boat and the Railway
have marked for a mighty change in
the earth; and in which they may be
only the first fruits of scientific skill,
the promises of inventions still more
powerful, the heralds of a general progress
of mankind, to whose colossal
strides all the past is feeble, unpurposed,
and ineffectual.</p>

<p>The invasion of the Mexican territory
by the army of the United States
has naturally attracted the eyes of
Europe; and whether the war shall
issue in a total conquest or in a hollow
peace, its results must strongly affect
the future condition of the country.
Mexico must at once take the bold
attitude of an empire, or must be dis-severed,
province by province, until
its very name is no more. But no
country of the western world has
a position more fitted for empire.
Washed on the east by the gulf which
bears its name, and on the west by
the Pacific, it thus possesses direct
access to two oceans, and by them to
the most opulent regions of the globe.
On the south it can dread no rival in
the struggling state of Guatemala.
But the north is the true frontier on
which the battle of its existence is to
be fought, if fought at all, for beyond
that barrier stretch the United States.
The extent of its territory startles
European conceptions, extending in
north latitude from fifteen to forty-two
degrees, and in west longitude
from eighty-seven to one hundred and
twenty-five degrees. Its surface, on
a general calculation, contains about
a million and a half of square miles,
or about <em>seven</em> times the dimensions of
France. Yet, though thus approaching
the equator, the climate of Mexico is in
general highly favourable to life and
to the products of the temperate zone:
the incomparably larger portion of its
surface being a succession of table-lands
or elevated plains, where, with
the sun of the tropics blazing almost
vertically, the evenings are refreshingly
cool, the breeze is felt from the mountains
or the ocean, and the days are
scarcely hotter than those of Europe.</p>

<p>We now glance at the principal
features of the great territory.</p>

<p>Vera Cruz, its chief commercial
city, and medium of intercourse with
Europe, is handsomely built, exhibiting
the usual signs of commercial
wealth, in the stateliness of its private
houses, and in the rarer peculiarity
of wide and cleanly streets. But
when did commerce build with any
other consideration than that of
trade? Vera Cruz is proverbially
unhealthy; a range of swamps in the
vicinity loads the summer air with
fatal exhalations; and the Vomito,
the name for a rapid disease, evidently
akin to the fearful Black-vomit of
Africa, requires either the most vigilant
precaution, or more probably the
most fortunate chance, to escape its
immediate seizure of the frame. Yet
it is said that this disease seldom attacks
the natives of the city.</p>

<p>But the general susceptibility of the
European frame to tropical disease, is
tried here in almost every shape of
suffering; and typhus, yellow fever,
and almost pestilence, terribly thin
the concourse of the stranger.</p>

<p>Yet such is the courage of money-making
in all parts of the world, that
climate is regarded as only a bugbear.
The trader in Vera Cruz enters on
the campaign against “all the ills
that flesh is heir to,” as if he had a
patent for life. The streets, in the
trading season, exhibit perpetual
crowds; the harbour is full of masts,
nestling under the protection of St
Juan d’Ulloa from the bursts of
wind which sometimes come with
terrible violence from the north; and
the funeral and the festivity go on
together, and without much impeding
each other, in a land which for the
time exhibits the very Festino, or
fête of the Merchant, the Sailor, and
the Creole.</p>

<p>But, when this season ends, Vera<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Cruz is as sad as a dungeon, as silent
as a monastery, and as sickly as an
hospital. The señoras, a race of perfectly
Spanish-visaged, black-eyed,
and very coquettish beauties, sit all
day drooping in their balconies, like
doves upon the housetops, perhaps
longing for a hurricane, an earthquake,
or any thing which may break up
the monotony of their existence. The
sound of a guitar, a passing footstep,
nay, the whine of a beggar, sets a
whole street in motion, and there is
a general rustling of mantillas, and a
general rush to the windows. The
men bear their calamity better; the
señor, when he has once a cigar between
his sallow lips, has made up
his mind for the day. Whether he
stands in the sunshine or sits in the
shade—whether he wakes or sleeps,
the cigar serves him for all the exercise
of his animal functions. His
brain is as much enveloped in smoke
as his moustaches; his cares vanish
like the smoke itself. It is not until
his cigar-box is empty, that he reverts
to the consciousness of his being
an inhabitant of this world of ours.</p>

<p>But some are of a more aspiring
disposition. They now and then
glance round upon the noble landscape
which encircles their city. But
they do this with the most dexterous
determination not to move a limb.
Their houses are flat-roofed; some of
them have little glazed chambers on
the roofs; and there they sit with the
sky above them, the mountains round
them, and the sea beneath them,
dreaming away like so many dormice.
One of their American describers
compares the whole well-bred
population to a colony of beavers;
but, we presume, <em>without</em> the
industry of the quadruped. Their
still closer resemblance would be to a
wax-work collection on a large scale,
where tinsel petticoats, woollen wigs,
and bugle eyes imitate humanity,
and every thing is before the spectator
but life.</p>

<p>Jonathan, who thinks himself born
to lay hold on every scrap of the
globe by which he can turn one cent
into two, looks, of course, on the
whole shore of the gulf—towns, mines,
and mountains—as his own. He
frees himself from all scruples on
the subject by the obvious convenience
of the conception.</p>

<p>“No spot of the earth,” says one
of those neighbourly persons, “will
be more desirable than the soil of
Mexico for a residence, whenever it
is in possession of <em>our race</em>, with the
government and laws which they
carry with them wherever they go.
The march of time is not more certain
than that <em>this will be</em>, and probably
at <em>no distant day</em>.”</p>

<p>And, on this showing, the man of
“government and laws” proceeds to
“sink, burn, and destroy,” in the
“great cause of humanity,” edifies
the native by grapeshot, and polishes
him with the cutlass. In those exploits
of a “free and enlightened”
people, our only surprise is that diplomacy
itself takes the trouble of offering
any apology whatever. The comparative
powers of resistance and
attack settle the conscience of the
affair in a word. The seizure is easy,
and therefore why should it not be
made? The riflemen of Kentucky
and the hunters of Virginia, the
squatters of Ohio and the sympathizers
of Massachusets, all see the
affair in the proper light; and why
should the philosopher or the philanthropist,
the man of justice or the
man of religion, be listened to on
subjects so much more easily settled
by the rattle of twelve-pounders?
The right of making war on Mexico
has not yet found a single defender
but in the streets; not a single ground
of defence but in the roar of the rabble;
not a single plea but in the convenience
of the possession. Even the
American journals have given up their
old half-savage rant of universal conquest.
Every drop of blood shed in
a war of aggression is sure to be
avenged.</p>

<p>The present town is not the town
of Cortes. His “Villa Rica de Vera
Cruz” (The Rich City of the True
Cross) was seated six miles further
inland. But trade decided against
the choice of the great soldier. The
pen, in this instance, conquered the
sword a century before the conflict
began in Europe. The population of
the old city slipped away to the new
and hasty hovels on the shore; and
the ground consecrated by the banner
of the Spanish hero was left to the
donkey and the thistle.</p>

<p>The visible protector of the city and
harbour (it has saints innumerable)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
is the island of St Juan de Ulloa,
lying within 600 yards of the mole;
and on which stands the well-known
fortress. Ships, of course, pass immediately
under its guns; and it is
regarded as the most powerful fortress
in Mexico, or perhaps in the New
World, being now thoroughly armed.
This is a different state of things from
the condition in which it was found
by the French squadron in 1839. The
ramparts were then scarcely mounted,
the guns were more dangerous to the
garrison than to the enemy, and of
regular artillerists there were few or
none; engineers were unheard of.
The French naturally did as they
pleased; achieved a magnanimous
triumph over bare walls, and plucked
a laurel for the Prince de Joinville
from the most barren of all possible
soils of victory; but it served for a
bulletin. They would probably now
find another kind of reception, for the
ramparts <em>have</em> guns, and the guns
have artillerymen.</p>

<p>The aspect of the Mexican coast
from the sea is singularly bold. On
the north and west the waters of the
Gulf wash a level shore; but on the
south all is a crescent of mountains,
rising to a general height of 12,000
feet above the level of the sea; but
the noblest object is the snow-capped
pinnacle of Orizaba, rising, according
to Humboldt, 17,400 feet, and covered
with perpetual snow from the height
of 15,092. This is a volcanic mountain,
but which has slept since the
middle of the sixteenth century; what
must have been its magnificence when
its summit was covered with flame!</p>

<p>The mode of conveyance between
Vera Cruz and Mexico is chiefly by
an establishment of stage-coaches,
making three journeys a-week between
the capitals. Those vehicles,
originally established by an American
of the United States, are now the
property of a Mexican whom they
are rapidly making rich. The horses
are Mexican, and, though small, are
strong and spirited. The stage leaves
Vera Cruz at eleven at night, and
arrives about three o’clock in the
next afternoon at Jalapa, a distance
of about seventy miles, and a continual
ascent through mountains. The
houses on the wayside are few and
wretched, constructed of canes ten
feet long, fixed in the ground, and
covered with palm-tree leaves. The
villages strongly resemble those of the
American Indians; hovels ten or
twelve feet square, with a small patch
of ground for Chillies and Indian
corn—the only difference of those
original styles of architecture being,
that the northern builds with logs,
the southern with mud in the shape
of bricks.</p>

<p>A large portion of the country between
those two towns belonged to
the well-known General Santa Anna.
The soil of his vast estate is fertile,
but left to its natural fertility—the
General being a shepherd, and said to
have from forty to fifty thousand head
of cattle in his pastures. He also acts
the farmer, and takes in cattle to
graze. His demand is certainly not
high; and Yorkshire will be astonished
to hear that he feeds them at
forty dollars the hundred.</p>

<p>The ascent of the mountain range,
and the varieties of the road, naturally
keep the traveller on the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">qui
vive</i>. With the air singularly transparent,
with the brightest of skies
above, and the most varied of southern
landscapes stretching to an unlimited
extent below, the eye finds a continual
feast. The city of Jalapa stands on
the slope, throned on a shelf of the
mountain 4000 feet above the sea,
and with 4000 feet of the bold and
sunny range above it. The whole
horizon, except in the direction of
Vera Cruz, is a circle of mountains,
and towering above them all, at a distance
of twenty-five miles, (which,
from the clearness of the air, seems
scarcely the fourth part of the distance,)
rises the splendid cone of Orizaba. On
the summit of the range stands Perote,
a town connected with a strong fortress,
perhaps the highest in position that
the world exhibits—8500 feet above
the shore.</p>

<p>Height makes the difference between
heat and cold every where. In
the middle of a summer which burns
the blood in the human frame at Vera
Cruz, men in Perote button their coats
to the chin, and sleep in blankets.
Thus winter is brought from the Poles
to the Tropic, and the Mexican shivers
under the most fiery sunshine of the
globe.</p>

<p>The next stage is Puebla—eighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
miles; the road passes over a vast
plain generally without a sign of cultivation,
as generally destitute of inhabitants,
and with scarcely a tree,
and scarcely a stream. It is difficult
to know to what purpose this huge
prairie can be turned, except to a
field of battle. As the road approaches
Puebla, there are farms erected by the
town, and from which its wants are
chiefly supplied. They produce wheat,
barley, and Indian corn. The only
fodder for horses is wheaten straw,
but on this they contrive to “grow
fat;” we are not called on to account
for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>But every nation loves to intoxicate
itself, and the Mexican boasts of
the most nauseous invention for the
purpose among the discoveries of man.
Pulque, the national beverage, is the
juice of the Agave Americana, fermented.
The original process by
which the fermentation is produced
is one which we shall not venture to
detail; but the liquor obtained from
the section of the plant is drawn up
by a rude syphon, and poured into
dressed ox-hides. The taste is mawkish,
and the smell is noisome. Yet,
to the Mexican, it is nectar and ambrosia
together. Pulque is to him
meat, drink, and clothing, for without
it the world has no pleasures. The
most remarkable circumstance is, that
it is without strength. Thus it wants
the charm of brandy, which may
madden, but which at least warms;
or aquafortis, which the Pole and the
Russ are said to drink as a qualifier
of their excesses in train oil; but the
Mexican would rather die, or even
fight, than dispense with his pulque;
and if Santa Anna had but put his
warriors on short allowance of the
national liquor before his last battle,
and promised them double allowance
after it, he would probably have been,
at this moment, on the Mexican throne.</p>

<p>The Agave, called by the natives
Maguey, is certainly an extraordinary
instance of succulency, and an unrivalled
acquisition to a thirsty population.
A single plant of the Agave
has been known to supply one hundred
and fifty gallons of this sap.
In good land it grows to an enormous
size, the centre stem often thirty feet
high, and twelve or fifteen inches in
diameter at the bottom. When the
plant is in flower, which occurs from
seven to fifteen years old, the centre
stem is cut off at the bottom, and the
juice is collected.</p>

<p>Humbolt says, that a single plant
will yield four hundred and fifty-two
cubic inches of liquor in twenty-four
hours, for four or five months, which
would give upwards of four hundred
gallons. How curious are the distributions
of nature! All this profuse
efflux of mawkish fluid would be
thrown away in any other country.
But nature has given the Mexican a
palate for its enjoyment, and to him
the draught is rapture.</p>

<p>Mexico is the land for the lovers of
pumice-stone. The whole road from
Vera Cruz to the capital is covered
with remnants of lava. Every plain
seems to have been burnt up by eruptions
a thousand years old, or, according
to the time-table of the geologist,
from ten to ten thousand millions of
years ago. With the mountain tops
all on fire, and the plains waving with
an inundation of flame, Mexico must
have been a splendid, though rather
an inconvenient residence, in the
“olden time.”</p>

<p>Mexican agriculture has not yet
attained the invention of an iron
ploughshare; its substitute is primitive,
and wooden. It evidently dates
as far back as the times of the Dispersion.
Nor, with thousands and
tens of thousands of horses, have they
yet discovered that a horse may be
yoked to a plough. The Turks say,
that the plague exists only where
Mahometanism is the religion, and
they seem to regard the distinction as
a peculiar favour of Providence. It has
been said by, or for, the Spaniards of
the present day, that no railroad exists,
nor, we presume, <em>can</em> exist,
“where the Spanish language is
spoken.” The late abortive attempts
to make a railway from Bayonne to Madrid,
so far prove the incompatibility of
railways with the tongue of the Peninsula.
A little effort of human presumption
in Cuba, has been ventured
on, in the shape of a brief railway,
which already goes, as we are informed,
at the rate of some half-dozen
miles an hour. But as this is a dangerous
speed to a Spaniard, we naturally
suppose that the enterprise will
be abandoned. But though the majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
of the population, between
drinking pulque and smoking cigars,
find their hands completely full, one
class is at least sufficiently active.
Robbers in Mexico are what pedlars used
to be in England; they keep up
the life of the villages, plunder wherever
they can, cheat where they cannot
plunder, ride stout horses, and
lead, on the whole, a varied, and
sometimes a very gay life. One of
the American travellers saw, at one of
the villages where the stage changed
horses, a dashing and picturesque
figure, gaudily dressed, who rode by
on a handsome horse richly caparisoned.
On inquiring if the coachman
knew him, the answer was, that he
knew him perfectly well, and that he
was the captain of a band of robbers,
who had plundered the stage several
times since the whip and reins had
been in his hands. On the Americans
urging the question, why he had not
brought the robber to punishment, the
answer was, “that he would be sure to
be shot by some of the band the
next time he passed the road;” the
honour of Mexican thieves being peculiarly
nice upon this point. It appeared
that the dashing horseman
had gone through the village on a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">reconnaissance</i>, but probably not liking
the obvious preparations of the travellers,
had postponed the caption.</p>

<p>The mode of managing things in
this somnolent country, is remarkable
for its tranquillity. The American
who narrates the circumstance, had
taken with him from Vera Cruz four
dragoons; but on accidentally enquiring
on the road into the state of their
arms, he found that but one carabine
had a lock in fighting order, and even
that one was not loaded; on which he
dismissed the guard, and trusted to
his companions, who were all well
armed. The Mexican travellers, taking
the matter in another way, never carry
arms, but prepare a small purse “to
be robbed of,” of which they are robbed
accordingly. A few miles from
Perote, the road winds round a high
hill, and the passengers generally get
out and walk. The Americans on this
occasion had left their arms in the
carriage, but their more prudent chief
immediately ordered them to carry
them in their hands, and in the course
of the ascent, they pounced upon a
group of ruffians whom the driver
pronounced to be robbers; and who,
but for their arms, would probably
have attacked them. In less than a
month after this, five or six Americans
having left their arms in the
stage at this spot, <em>were</em> attacked, and
stript of every cent belonging to them.</p>

<p>It must be owned that this country
has fine advantages for the gentlemen
of the road. The highway between
Vera Cruz and Mexico is the great
conduit of life in the country. Nearly
all the commerce goes by that way,
and ninety out of every hundred travellers
pass by the same route. The
chief portion of the road is through an
absolute desert. It frequently winds
up the sides of mountains, and then
is bordered by forests of evergreens,
forming a capital shelter for the land
pirate, the whole being a combination
of Hounslow Heath and Shooter’s
Hill on a grand scale, and making
highway robbery not merely a showy
but a safe speculation, the gaming-table
being the chief recruiting-office
of the whole battalion of Mercury.</p>

<p>The statistics of gaming might borrow
a chapter from Mexico. The
passion for play is public, universal,
and unbounded. It is probably superior
even to the passion for pulque.
Every one plays, and plays for all
that he is worth in the world, and
often for more. But he has his resource—the
road. A man who has
lost his last dollar, but who is determined
to play on till he dies, lays
himself under strong temptations of
coveting his neighbour’s goods. The
hour when the stages pass is known
to every one; the points of the road
where they must go slowly up the
hill, are familiar to all highway recollections.
Associates are expeditiously
found among the loiterers, who, after
their own ruin, sit round the room
watching the luck of others. The
band is formed in a moment; they
take the road without delay, post
themselves in the evergreens, enjoy
the finest imaginable prospect, and
breathe the most refreshing air, until
the creaking of the coach-wheels puts
them on the alert. They then exhibit
their weapons, the passengers produce
their little purses, the stage is
robbed of every thing portable, or
convertible into cash, the band return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
to the gaming-table, fling out their
coin, and play till they are either rich
or ruined once more.</p>

<p>Some time after an adventure,
such as we have described, the stage
was robbed near Puebla by a gang,
all of whom had the appearance of
gentlemen. When the operation of
rifling every body and every thing
was completed, one of the robbers
observed—“that they must not be
looked on as professional thieves, for
they were gentlemen; but having
been unfortunate at play, they were
forced to put the company to this inconvenience,
for which they requested
their particular pardon.”</p>

<p>An incident of this order occurring
in the instance of a public personage,
some years before, long excited remarkable
interest. The Swiss consul
had been assassinated at noonday.
A carriage had driven up to his door,
out of which three men came, one in
the dress of a priest. On the doors
being opened they seized and gagged
the porter, rushed into the apartment
where the consul was sitting, murdered
and robbed him, and then retreated.
None knew whence they
came or whither they went; but the
murdered man, in his dying struggle,
had torn a button off the coat of one
of the robbers, which they found still
clenched in his hand. A soldier was
shortly after seen with more money
than he could account for; suspicion
naturally fell upon him; his quarters
were searched, and one of his coats
was found with the button torn off.
He was convicted, but relied upon a
pardon through the Colonel Yanez,
chief aide-de-camp of the president
Santa Anna, who was his accomplice
in the transaction. On being brought
out for execution, and placed on
the fatal bench where criminals are
strangled, he cried out, “Stop, I will
acknowledge my accomplices;” and
he pronounced the name of the colonel.
Search was immediately made
in the house of Yanez, and a letter in
cipher was found, connecting him
with this and other robberies. This
letter was left in the hands of one of
the judges: he was offered a large
sum to destroy it, and refused. In a
few days after he was found dead, as
was supposed, by poison. The paper
was then transferred to another judge
who was offered the same bribe, and
who promised to destroy it; but on
conferring with his priest, though he
took the money, he shrank from the
actual destruction of the document
and kept it in silence. Yanez was
brought to trial, and, believing that
the paper was no longer in existence,
treated the charge with contempt. The
paper was produced, and the aide-de-camp
was condemned and executed.</p>

<p>Puebla is one of the handsomest
cities in the Mexican territory. The
houses are lofty, and in good taste,
and the streets are wide and clean
About six miles from the city stood
Choluta, which Cortes described “as
having a population of forty thousand
citizens, well clothed,” and as it
might appear, peculiarly devout according
to their own style, for the
conqueror counted in it the towers of
four hundred idol temples. Of this
city not a vestige remains but an immense
mound of brick, on which now
stands a Romish chapel.</p>

<p>Beyond Puebla, cultivation extends
to a considerable distance on both
sides of the road. To the right lies
the republic of Tlascala, so memorable
in the history of the Spanish
conquest, and once crowded with a
population of warriors. The road
then runs at the foot of Pococatapetl,
the highest of the Mexican mountains,
seventeen thousand feet above the
level of the sea. The capital is now
approached; and on passing over the
next ridge, the first glimpse is caught
of the famous valley and city of Mexico.
From this ridge Cortes had the
first view of his conquest. It must
have been an object of indescribable
interest to the great soldier who had
fought his way to the possession of
the noblest prize of his age. The valley
of Mexico, a circuit of seventeen
hundred square miles, must then have
been a most magnificent sight, if it
be true that it contained “forty cities,
and villages without number.” Time,
war, and the fatal government of
Spain, have nearly turned this splendid
tract into a desert. But it still
has features combining the picturesque
with the grand. The valley partially
resembles the crater of an immense
volcano wholly surrounded by mountains,
some of them rising ten thousand
feet above the city. In the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
of this vast oval basin is a lake,
or rather a chain of lakes, through
the midst of which the road now
passes for about eighteen miles, on a
raised causeway. The city stands in
the north-eastern quarter of the valley,
not more than three miles from the
mountains, at an elevation of seven
thousand four hundred and seventy
feet, and its position seems obviously
made for the capital of an empire.</p>

<p>Mexico is regarded as the “stateliest
city” in the New World. Its
plan was laid, and the principal portion
of its public buildings are said to
have been designed, by Cortes. They
bear all the impress of a superb mind.
The habitual meanness of democratical
building has no place there; the majority
of the fabrics were evidently
constructed by a man to whom the
royal architecture of the European
nations was familiar, and the finest
houses in the city are still inhabited
by the descendants of the conqueror.</p>

<p>The principal square is the pride of
the Mexicans, and the admiration of
travellers. It has an area of twelve
acres; unluckily, this fine space,
which in England would be covered
with verdant turf, shrubs, and flowers,
is covered only with pavement. But
the buildings are on a noble scale.
The Cathedral fills one whole side of
the square, the Palace another, and
the sites of both are memorable and
historical; the Cathedral standing
on the ground where once stood the
great idol temple, and the Palace on
the ground of the palace of Montezuma!
The latter building is 500 feet
long, and contains the public offices,
besides the apartments of the President.
The Cathedral is of striking
Gothic architecture, and after all the
pressures and plunderings of the later
period, still retains immense wealth.
The high altar is covered with plates
of silver, interspersed with ornaments
of massive gold. This altar is inclosed with
a balustrade a hundred
feet long, not less precious than the
high altar itself. It is composed of
an amalgam of gold, silver, and copper,
richly flourished and figured. It
is said that an offer had been made
to purchase it at its weight in silver,
giving half a million of dollars besides.
Of this balustrade there are
not less in the building than 300 feet.
Statues, vases, and huge candlesticks
of the precious metals, meet the eye
every where; and yet it is said that
the still more precious portion of the
treasure is hidden from the popular
eye. The streets are wide, and cross
each other at right angles, dividing
the whole city into squares. But the
Romish habit of giving the most sacred
names to common things, is
acted on in Mexico with most offensive
familiarity. The names of the
streets are instances of this profanation,
which has existed wherever
monks have been the masters. Thus,
the Mexican will tell you that he lives
in “Jesus,” or in the “Holy Ghost.”
In the Spanish navy the most sacred
names were similarly profaned; and the
Santissima Trinidada (the Most Holy
Trinity) was a flag-ship in the fleet
destroyed at Trafalgar. What blasphemies
and brutalities must not have
been mingled with this sacred name
in the mouths of a crew!</p>

<p>The churches are the chief buildings
in the city, some of them of great
size, and all filled with plate and other
wealth. Yet the houses, even of the
most opulent families, exhibit some of
the vilest habits of the vilest southern
cities of Europe. To pass over other
matters, in the whole city there is
perhaps not a stable separate from the
house. The stud is on the basement
story, and it may be conceived how
repulsive must be the effects of such
an arrangement in the burning climate
of Mexico! The servants’ rooms
are also upon this floor; and in some
of the principal houses the visitors have
to pass through this row of stables and
sleeping rooms on their way to the
chief apartments. In some, too, of
the larger private houses, no less than
thirty or forty families reside, each
renting one or two rooms, and having
a common stair of exit to the street.
This crowding of families is produced,
in the first instance, by the narrow
limits of the city, which is scarcely
more than two miles in length by a
mile and a half in breadth; and in
the next, by the lazy habits of their
Spanish ancestry, which still gathered
them together for the sake of gossiping
and idling, and which seem every
where to have had an abhorrence
of cleanliness, of fresh air, and of the
sight of a field; the population thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
festering on each other, while the
country round them is open, healthful,
and cheerful. The inhabitants, to
the amount of two hundred thousand,
evidently prefer half suffocation in an
atmosphere that tortures the nostrils
of all strangers; and are content with
the dust and dimness, the heat and
the effluvia, naturally generated by a
tropical sun acting upon a crowded
population.</p>

<p>In addition to this voluntary offence,
Mexico has two natural
plagues, inundations and earthquakes.
The city was once a kind of American
Venice, wholly surrounded by
water, penetrated by water, and built
on piles in the water. A gigantic
canal, which was tunnelled through
its mountain barrier in the beginning
of the seventeenth century, partially
drained the waters of the lakes, and
left it on firm ground. But the lakes,
from time to time, take their revenge;
clouds of a peculiarly ominous aspect
begin to roll along the mountains,
until they break down in a deluge.
Then the genius of the land of monks
exhibits itself, and all the bells in the
city are rung, whether to frighten the
torrent, or to propitiate the Deity.
But the rain still comes down in
sheets, and the torrents roar louder.
The bells meet the enemy by still
louder peals. At length the clouds
are drained, and the torrents disappear;
the bells have the praise. The
city recovers its spirits, finds that its
time for being swept from the earth
has not yet arrived; the sun shines
once more, and the monks have all
the credit of this triumph over Satan
and Nature.</p>

<p>Mexico has its museum, and it contains
some curiosities which could not
be supplied in any other part of the
world. They are almost wholly Mexican.
The weapons found among the
people at the time of the conquest:
rude lances, daggers, bows and arrows,
with the native armour of cotton, and
those wooden drums which the old
Spaniards seem to have dreaded more
than the arms. Among them is the
Mexican “razor sword,” a staff with
four projecting blades, made of volcanic
glass, and brought to such sharpness
that a stroke has been known to
cut off a horse’s head. In the museum
there are some still more curious specimens
of their manufactures, paper
made from the Cactus, with much of
their hieroglyphic writing on it. One
of these rolls exhibits the Mexican
idea of the deluge, and among other
details shows “the bird with a branch
in its claw.” It is said that they had
traditions of the leading events from
the Creation to the Deluge, nearly
resembling the Mosaic history; but
that from the Deluge downwards all
records have escaped them. But the
museum contains more modern and
more characteristic remains. Among
the rest, the armour of Cortes.</p>

<p>From its size, its wearer must have
been a man of small stature, and
about the size of Napoleon. The
armour of the brave Alvarado is also
in the museum, and is even smaller
than that of Cortes; but, as a covering
of the form, both are complete.
The wearer could have been vulnerable
only at the joints; the horse of the
man-at-arms was similarly protected,
being in fact covered all over either
with steel or bull’s hide. The use of
cannon finally put an end to the wearing
of armour, which was found to
be useless against weight of metal.
It is now partially reviving in the
cuirass, and unquestionably ought to
be revived among the infantry so far
as covering the front of the soldiers.
The idea is childish that this would
degrade the intrepidity of the troops.
The armour of knighthood did not degrade
its intrepidity; the cuirasses of
our dragoons have not degraded their
intrepidity; nor will any man be the
less daring from the sense that he is
less exposed to the casualties of the
field.</p>

<p>A colossal bronze statue of Charles
IV. stands in the court-yard of the
museum, but its history is of higher
value than its subject; that history
being, that it was designed by one
native Mexican, and cast by another.
Thus at least showing that the cultivation
of the fine arts is not impossible,
even in Spanish America.</p>

<p>There also is the great sacrificial
stone on which human victims bled,
a circular mass four feet high and eight
in diameter, with figures in relief elaborately
carved on the top and sides.
On this stone sixty-two of the companions
of Cortes were put to death
before the eyes of their countrymen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
The finance of Mexico becomes a
matter of European importance, in a
period which should be called the “Age
of Loans.” The debt in 1844 was
about one hundred millions of dollars,
of which sixty millions are due to
foreigners. But the territory is evidently
the richest in silver that the
world has yet seen, and possibly exceeding
in mineral wealth all the
world beside, if we except the gold
sands of the Ural, which have lately
teemed with such marvellous produce.
Humboldt reckoned no less than three
thousand silver mines in Mexico in
the year 1804. But not one fiftieth
of those mines continue to be worked,
a result caused by the distance of
quicksilver in the mines of Old Spain.
The mines produce but little gold, and
that little is generally found in combination
with silver. But the quantity
of silver is absolutely astonishing.
The mines still continue to give a produce
as large as in any year of the
last two centuries, in which Humboldt
computes the average produce at
twelve millions of dollars annually.
But allowing for the quantity notoriously
smuggled out of the country,
besides the eighteen millions and a
half of gold and silver actually registered
for exportation, the produce may
amount to twenty-four millions of
dollars yearly. This increase evidently
arises from the greater tranquillity
of the country; for in the times of
actual revolution, it frequently sank
to three or four millions.</p>

<p>The American writer from whom
we have taken these calculations,
cannot help betraying the propensity
of Yankeeism, by talking of the wonders
which would be done in such a
country if it were once in the possession
of Jonathan. He thinks that the
produce of the mines would be “at
least five times as great as it is now,”
that every mine would be worked, and
that many more will be discovered.
Calculating the exports of British produce
at two hundred and sixty millions
of dollars yearly, he thinks that “Mexico,
if in full action, would equal that
amount in ten years.” But his words
are more significant still with respect
to the relations of the United States.
We are to remember that those words
were written previously to the aggression
which has just taken place against
Mexico, and which the Americans
pretend to be perfectly innocent and
justifiable. And also, that they are
written by an American minister.
“Recent manifestation,” says this
writer, “of a rabid, not to say rapacious
spirit of acquisition of territory
on the part of our countrymen, may
well cause a race so inferior in all the
elements of power to tremble for the
tenure by which they hold this Eldorado.
It is not often, with nations at
least, that such temptations are resisted,
or that ‘danger winks on opportunity.’
I trust, however, that
our maxim ever will be, ‘noble ends
by worthy means,’ and that we may
remember that wealth improperly acquired
never ultimately benefited an
individual or a nation.”</p>

<p>Those are wise and just sentiments.
But we unluckily see the practical
morality of the Americans on the subject,
in the invasion of the territory,
and the slaughter of the natives.</p>

<p>The mineral produce is not confined
to gold and silver. No country produces
larger masses of that iron which
so much better deserves the name of
precious metal, if we are to estimate
its value by its use. And tin, lead,
and copper are also found in large
masses.</p>

<p>The fertility of the soil, where it receives
any tolerable cultivation, is also
remarkable, and two crops may be
raised in one year. But the farmers
have neither capital nor inclination to
cultivate the soil. Having no market,
they have no use for their superfluity,
and therefore they raise no superfluity.
A considerable portion of the whole
territory is also distributed into immense
pastures of eighty or a hundred
thousand cattle, and fifteen or
twenty thousand mules and horses,
the grass being green all the year
round, and those animals being left to
the course of nature. Yet, except
when there is a government demand
to mount the cavalry, those immense
herds of horses seldom find a purchaser,
nearly all agricultural work
being done by oxen. Horses are sold
at from eight to ten dollars a-piece.
But the Mexicans exhibit the old Spanish
preference for mules and a pair of
handsome carriage mules will cost
one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Thus, in all the precious products of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
the earth, Mexico may stand rivalry
with the most favoured nations. It
is the land of the cochineal; it produces
all the rice which is required
for the food of the people; the silk-worm
might there be multiplied to
any extent; cotton can be raised in
almost every province to a boundless
amount. The high grounds are covered
with fine timber, and, where nothing
else is produced, bee’s-wax abounds;
this is consumed chiefly in the churches,
where a part of their religion consists
in keeping candles perpetually burning.
Yet the Mexican bee-masters
are as careless as the rest of their
countrymen, and they do not produce
wax enough for this holy ignition,
and great quantities are imported accordingly.</p>

<p>The history of Mexico, since the
Spanish conquest, is a combination of
the histories of European sovereignty
and American republicanism.</p>

<p>Mexico was not among the discoveries
of the great Columbus,
though he approached Yucatan. That
peninsula was first seen in 1517 by
Cordova. In 1519 the famous Hernan
Cortes landed on the site of Vera
Cruz. After founding Villa Rica, he
began his memorable march into the
territory of Montezuma, King of the
Aztecs. It cost him two years of
desperate struggle to make good his
ground; the Mexicans exhibited occasional
bravery, and fought with the
fervour of devotees to their king and
their idols. But the novelty of the
Spanish arms, the belief in an ancient
prediction that “the kingdom was to
be conquered from the sea,” and,
above all, the indefatigable bravery of
Cortes, finally established the supremacy
of Spain.</p>

<p>The great source of calamity to Spain
has always been its pride. The groundless
sense of personal superiority in
every thing belonging to Spain, its
religion, its government, its literature,
and its people, has, during the last four
hundred years of European advance,
kept Spain stationary. The country
was pronounced to be perfect, and
what is the use of trying to improve
perfection? But the Spaniard pronounced
himself as perfect as the
country; and, therefore, what was the
use of his adopting the inventions,
habits, or intelligence of others? He
disdained them all, and therefore continued
the byword of ignorance, arrogance,
and prejudice, to all nations.
The troops of Cortes, and the gallant
adventurers who followed them as
settlers in the Spanish colonies, had
descendants who soon began to form
a powerful population. Among those,
a government possessed of common
sense would have found the natural
support of the parent state. But the
man of Spain scorned to acknowledge
the equality even of the Spanish
blood, when born in the colonies;
and no office of trust, and no commission
in the colonial troops, could be
given to a Creole. The foundation of
hostility was thus laid at once, and
on it was raised a large superstructure.</p>

<p>Another race soon rose, the children
of Spaniards by native women,
the Mestizos. They, too, were excluded
from all employments. The
revolt of the United States would
probably have applied the torch to
this mass of combustible matter, but
for the jealousy of the two races. As
the men of Old Spain despised the
Creole, the Creole despised the Mestizo.
Thus the power of Spain remained
guarded by the jealousies of both.</p>

<p>But a new period was at hand.
The infamous seizure of Spain by
Napoleon in 1808, roused both races
to an abhorrence of the French name,
and a determination to separate themselves
from a kingdom which could
now be regarded only as a French
province. Again jealousy prevailed;
the Creoles demanded a national representation,
the Spanish troops and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">employés</i> a royal government. In the
midst of their disputes, a powerful
enemy appeared. The Mestizos and
Indians united under a village priest,
Hidalgo, and overran the country.
This incursion brought the disputants
to a sense of their own peril; they collected
troops, were beaten by the
bold priest, rallied for another field,
beat him, took him prisoner in the
battle, and put him to death.</p>

<p>But the spirit of revolt had now
become popular, and another priest,
Morellos, was found to head another
insurrection. His talents and intrepidity
swept all before him for a
period, and the “independence of
Mexico” was declared by a “national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
assembly” in November 1813.
But Morellos was finally unfortunate,
was attacked by the Spanish general
Colleja, who seems to have been a
man of military genius, was taken
prisoner, and shot. The Old Spaniards
were once more masters, and Apodaca,
a man of intelligence and conduct,
was sent from Spain as viceroy.</p>

<p>But sudden tumults broke out in
Spain itself. The “Constitution of
1820” was proclaimed, the parties in
Mexico followed the example, and a
constitution strongly tending to democracy
was proposed. It produced
a total dissolution of the alliance between
the Creoles and the Old Spaniards,
the former demanding a government
virtually independent, the
latter adhering to Spain. In the
confusion, Iturbide, a young Creole
of an ancient family, and of large
possessions, pushed his way into
power, and, to the astonishment of
all Western republicanism, in 1822
proclaimed himself Augustin the First,
<em>Emperor</em> of Mexico.</p>

<p>But he instantly committed the capital
fault of quarrelling with his congress.
By a rash policy he dissolved
the assembly and appointed another,
composed of his adherents. But
Cromwell’s boldness required Cromwell’s
abilities to sustain it. The
army had been the actual givers of
the throne, and what they had given
they regarded themselves as having
the right to resume. The generals
revolted against Iturbide, overthrew
him, proclaimed a new constitution,
and sent him to travel in Europe on
a pension!</p>

<p>The constitution thus formed (October
1824) was republican, and took
for its model that of the United States.
Its two assemblies are a senate and a
house of representatives. The senate
consisting of two members for each
state; the representatives, of two for
every eighty thousand inhabitants.
All must be natives, and have landed
property to the amount of eight thousand
dollars, or some trade or profession
which brings in ten thousand
dollars annually. The congress sits
every year from the first of January
to the middle of April. The senators
holding their seats for four years, generally;
the representatives for two.
The executive is vested in a president
and vice-president, both elected
by the state legislatures for four
years. The ages of the several functionaries
are curiously fixed. The
representative must have attained the
age of twenty-five, the senator of
thirty, and the high officers of state
thirty-five.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> The whole territory
forms one “Federal Republic, governed
by one Executive,” a marked
distinction between Mexico and its
model; the several states of the American
Union retaining to themselves
many of the privileges which, in the
Mexican, belong to the government
of the capital.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_A" href="#FNanchor_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> There have been some subsequent changes in these matters.</p></div>

<p>Iturbide, after a two years’ exile,
whether uneasy in his fall, or tempted
by the perpetual tumults of party at
home, returned to Mexico in 1824.
He was said to complain of the stoppage
of his pension; but, before his
arrival, a party especially hostile to
him had obtained power, and Iturbide,
with a rashness which exhibits the
true Creole, landing, without making
the natural inquiry into the actual
condition of things, was instantly
seized and shot. Santa Anna, who
had distinguished himself in the military
service, now appealed to the
usual donor of power, the army, and,
at the head of his squadrons, took
possession of the Presidentship.</p>

<p>In the present confusion of Mexican
affairs, the recollection of Santa Anna
has been frequently brought before
the mind of his nation, as the only
man fit to sustain it under the difficulties
of the crisis; and nothing can
be more fully acknowledged, than
that, among the successive leaders of
the country, he has had no rival in
point of decision, intelligence, and intrepidity,
the qualities obviously most
essential for the time.</p>

<p>Santa Anna, in 1823, was unknown;
he was simply a colonel in the Mexican
service. The declaration of public
opinion in that year for Republicanism,
found him a zealous convert;
and at the head of his regiment he
marched from Vera Cruz to meet the
troops of Iturbide. He met the Emperor’s
general, Echavari, half-way to
the capital, and, after some trivial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
encounters, made a convert of his
enemy; Echavari’s battalions marched
into Santa Anna’s camp. Iturbide,
thus suddenly stript of his troops, had
no alternative but to capitulate, and
go into banishment. The Republic
was proclaimed, and Santa Anna was
recognised as the deliverer of his
country. But an occasion occurred
in which his military talents were to
be equally conspicuous.</p>

<p>In 1829, a Spanish armament, with
four thousand troops under General
Barrados, made its appearance off
Tampico, dispatched to recover the
country for the Spanish crown. This
instance of activity on the part of Old
Spain was so unexpected, that the
Republic was in general consternation.
But Santa Anna took his measures
with equal intelligence and
bravery. Collecting about seven hundred
men hastily, crossing the Gulf in
open boats, and evading the Spanish
vessels of war, he landed within a few
miles of the Spanish expedition. Barrados,
unprepared for this dashing
antagonist, had gone on some rash
excursion, carrying with him three-fourths
of his force; the remaining
thousand were the garrison of Tampico.
Santa Anna, losing no time, assaulted
the place next morning, and after a
four hours’ struggle, made the whole
garrison prisoners. But his victory had
placed him in imminent danger. Barrados
rapidly returned; the Mexican
general, encumbered with prisoners,
found himself in presence of triple his
numbers, and with a river in his rear.
Death, or surrender, seemed the only
alternatives. In this emergency, he
dexterously proposed an armistice,
impressing the Spanish general with
the idea that he was at the head of
an overwhelming force—an impression
the more easily made, from the
apparent hardihood of his venturing
so near an army of Spanish veterans.
One of his first conditions was, that
the Mexican troops should return to
their own quarters unmolested. Thus,
with merely six hundred men, he
escaped from five times that number.
In a few days he was joined by several
hundred men. He then commenced a
vigorous and incessant attack on the
Spanish position, which was followed
by the surrender of the entire corps;
and 2200 Spaniards were embarked
for the Havannah as prisoners of war.
Santa Anna’s force never exceeding
1500 men.</p>

<p>A campaign of this rank naturally
placed him in a distinguished point of
public view. Yet he remained in
comparative quiet on his estates near
Vera Cruz, probably on the Napoleon
principle—waiting his opportunity.
It soon came; in 1841, Bustamente,
the president, fell into unpopularity;
murmurs rose ominously among the
troops, and Santa Anna was summoned
to head a revolution. Gathering
five or six hundred men, chiefly
raw recruits, he marched on the capital.
The enterprise was singularly
adventurous, for Bustamente was an
experienced officer, with 8000 men
under his immediate command. Santa
Anna again tried the effect of diplomacy;
the result was, that Bustamente
finally surrendered both his
power and his place, and was shortly
after sent into exile.</p>

<p>Santa Anna now governed the
country as dictator. His administration
had the rashness, but the honesty,
of his Spanish origin; and Mexico,
relieved from the encumbrances of her
Spanish dependence, was beginning
to enjoy the riches of her unparalleled
climate and boundless fertility, when
a new enemy arose in Texas—the
American settlers, who, in the spirit
of cosmopolitism, had been universally
suffered to enter the Mexican territories
as inhabitants. The result
was, that they began to clamour for
provincial independence. The natives
were generally tranquil; but the new-comers
intrigued, harangued, and
demanded a direct alliance with the
United States. The struggle has been
too recent to require recital. Santa
Anna, with the rashness which characterises
his courage, rushed into this
war with troops evidently unprepared.
After various skirmishes, in which the
settlers suffered severely, his undisciplined
force was routed, and Santa
Anna, left alone in the field, was made
prisoner in the attempt to escape.
The “Independence” of Texas followed,
which was quickly exchanged
for the “Annexation” to the United
States, by which its independence was
extinguished.</p>

<p>The “Annexation” was immediately
pronounced by the Mexican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
government to be a breach of that
treaty by which the neighbour States
were pledged to respect the possessions
of each other; and the invasion of
Mexico by an American army was
the consequence. The Mexican force
on the frontier was obviously too
feeble for any effective resistance;
and the American general, after some
delays of movement, and divisions of
his forces, which one active officer on
the defensive would have turned to
his ruin, attacked the Mexicans,
drove them from their position, and
took their guns. Since that period
the advance of the Americans seems
to have been checked by the difficulties
of the country. Whether it is
the intention of the American commander
to fight, or to negotiate, to
make a dash for the capital, or to
treat for California, must be left to be
discovered by events. But Paredes,
the present head of the state, and
commander of the troops, has the reputation
of a brave officer, and Santa
Anna is strongly spoken of as the
man whom the nation would gladly
summon to the redemption of his
country.</p>

<p>But Mexico has one fatal feature
which makes the mind despair of her
ever holding the rank of a great nation.
However glaring may be the superstition
of continental Europe, it is of
a feeble hue to the extravagance of
Mexican ceremonial. In those remote
countries, once guarded under the Spanish
government with the most jealous
vigilance from the stranger’s eye, every
ceremonial was gradually adopted, of
every shape and colour, which the
deepest superstition, aided by great
wealth, the influence of a powerful
hierarchy, and the zeal of a people at
once desperately ignorant and singularly
fond of show, could invent. Rome,
and even Naples, were moderate,
compared with Mexico. The conveyance
of the Host to the sick was
almost a public pageant; its carriage
to the wife of Santa Anna was
accompanied by twenty thousand
people. The feast of Corpus Christi
exhibits streets through which thirty
or forty thousand people pour along,
of all classes of society, with thousands
of soldiery, to swell and give military
brilliancy to the display. At the head
of the pageant moves a platform, on
which the wafer is borne by the highest
dignitaries of the church. Then follows,
in a similar vehicle, “Our Lady
of the Remedies,” the blessed Virgin
Mother, a little alabaster doll, with
the nose broken and an eye out. This
was the image of herself given by the
Virgin to Cortes to revive the valour
of his soldiers after their Mexican
defeat; and this the priests profess
to believe, and the populace actually
do believe. The doll’s wardrobe, with
its precious stones, is valued at a
million of dollars. The doll stops all
contagious diseases, and is remarkably
active in times of cholera.</p>

<p>Some of the popular exhibitions on
Scriptural subjects are actually too
startling to be described to Christian
ears. Among those is the exhibition
of the Nativity, as the especial display
of Christmas eve. Joseph enters
Bethlehem with Mary; they are
sitting on the same mule; they
search the city for lodgings in vain.
At last they find the stable. The
rest of the exhibition, a part of
which, however, passes behind a
curtain, is indescribable. And all
this is done with the highest approbation
of the ecclesiastical authorities.</p>

<p>The anniversary of the “Miracle”
of the “Virgin of Guadaloupe,” is
one of the “grand days” of the
Federal Republic. The president,
the cabinet, the archbishop, and all
the principal functionaries of the
state, are present, with an immense
multitude of every class. A member
of Congress delivers an oration on
the subject; and the Virgin and her
story are no more doubted than the
history of Magna Charta. The story
thus blazoned, and thus believed, is
briefly <span class="locked">this:—</span></p>

<p>An Indian, going to Mexico one
morning in the sixteenth century, saw
a female form descending from the sky.
He was frightened; but the female
told him that she was the Virgin
Mary, come down to be the patron of
the Mexican Indians, and ordered
him to announce to the bishop that a
church must be built in the mountain
where she met him. The Indian flew
to the bishop, but the prelate drove
him away. The next day he met the
Virgin on the same spot, and she
appointed a day to convince the sceptical
ecclesiastic. She bid him go to
the summit of the mountain, where
he should find the rock covered with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
roses for the first time since the Creation.
He carried the roses in his apron
to the bishop, when, lo! he found that
on his apron was stamped a figure
of the Virgin in a cloak of velvet
spangled with stars of gold! Her
proof was irresistible, and the church
was built. The original portrait is
still displayed there, in a golden frame
studded with precious stones, with the
motto, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Non fecit taliter omni nationi</i>.
(He hath not so done to every nation;
or, more significantly, to <em>any other</em>
nation.) Copies of the miraculous
picture, of more or less costliness, are
to be found in almost every house,
and all have the full homage of
saintship. The Church of the Virgin,
though not so large as the Cathedral,
is of a finer style, and nearly as rich;
the balustrade is pure silver, and all
the candelabra, &amp;c., are of the precious
metals.</p>

<p>The idleness and the low class of
life from which the majority of the
monks and friars are taken, make
celibacy especially dangerous to the
community. The higher orders of the
priesthood are comparatively decorous;
but many of them have these
suspicious appendages to a priest’s
household, which are called “house-keepers,”
with a proportionate share
of those equally suspicious appendages,
which are popularly called
“nephews and nieces,” the whole
system being one which furnishes a
large portion of the gossip of Mexican
society. But on those topics we have
no wish to dwell.</p>

<p>Whether the American invasion
will succeed in reaching Mexico, or
in obtaining Upper California, or in
breaking up the Federation, are matters
still in the future. The disruption
of the Federation seems to have been
already, and spontaneously begun;
Yucatan is said to have demanded
independence; and the northern provinces
bordering on the United States
will, in all probability, soon make
the same demand. It is obvious that
the present Mexican territory is too
large for the varying, distracted, and
feeble government which Mexico has
exhibited for the last quarter of a
century—a territory seven times the
size of France, or perhaps ten times
that size, can be governed by a central
capital only so long as the population
continues scanty, powerless,
and poor. But if Mexico had a population
proportionate to France, and
there is no reason for doubting its
capacity of supporting such a population,
the capital would govern a
territory containing little less than
three hundred millions of men; an
obvious impossibility, where those
men were active, opulent, intelligent,
and engaged in traffic with the world.
The example of the Chinese population
is <em>not</em> a contrary case. There
the empire was old, the throne almost
sacred, the imperial power supported
by a large military establishment,
the character of the people timid, and
the country in a state of mental stagnation.
Yet, even for China, great
changes may be at hand.</p>

<p>But the whole subject is to be looked
on in a more comprehensive point
of view. There <em>is</em> a general shaking
of nations. The Turk, the Egyptian,
the African, and the Chinese, have
all experienced an impulse within late
years, which has powerfully influenced
their whole system. That impulse is
now going westward. The immense
regions beyond the Atlantic are now
commencing the second stage of that
existence, of which their discovery
by Europe was the first. The language,
the habits and history, the
political feelings of England, are becoming
familiar to them. They have
begun their national education in the
great school of self-government, with
England for their teacher; and however
tardy may be the pupilage, or
however severe the events which turn
the theory into example, we have
strong faith in the conception, that all
things will finally work together for
good, and that a spirit of regeneration
is already sent forth on its mighty
mission to the New World as to the
Old, to the “bond as to the free;”
to those whom misgovernment has
enfeebled, and superstition has debased,
as to those who, possessing the
original advantages of civilisation and
religion, have struggled their difficult
way to increasing knowledge, truth,
and freedom, and whose progress has
alike conferred on them the power,
and laid upon them the duty, of being
the moral leaders of Mankind.</p>

<span class="i0">Behind the trunk, but quaintly reappears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through a rough cleft above, with busy bill<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Ah! there’s Miss Kitty Wren, with her cocked tail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocked like a cooper’s thumb. Miss Kitty goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ’neath the bank, and then comes out again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some queer hole. Thus, all the day she plies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her quest from hedge to bank, scarce ever seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flying above your head in open air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsmitten by the heat where now she is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She strikes into her song—Miss Kitty’s song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(We never think of male in Kitty’s case.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song is short, and varies not, but yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Tis not monotonous; with such a pipe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of liquid clearness does she open it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with increasing vigour, to the end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go through it quite: Thus, all the year, she sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except in frost, the spunky little bird!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mossy stump of thorn, her curious nest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is often built, a twig drawn over it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bind it firm; but more she loves the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sylvan cave over-arched, where the green twilight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimmers with golden light, and fox-gloves stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall, purple-faced, her goodly beef-eaters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To guard and dignify her entrance-gate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ballad vouches that a wee, wee bird<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So here’s our ear, Miss Wren, (your pardon! we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must call you Mrs now,) pray, tell us how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You manage, in your crowded little house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed your thirteen young, nor miss one mouth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What means the Bachelor’s Nest? ’Tis oftener found<br /></span>

<span class="i0">’Tis built as well; but ne’er we find within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cozy feathery lining for the home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love parental. Is it, as some think,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Made for your husband, whosoe’er he be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sleep o’nights in? Or, as others deem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it a lure to draw the loiterer’s eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off from the genuine nest, not far away?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is not his wife. See how he turns the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way and that, peeping from out the leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With curious eye, and still comes hopping nearer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong in his individual character,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His knowing glance, his shape, his waistcoat red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pipe mellifluous, and pugnacious pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darting to strike intruders from his beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And other qualities, his love of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is still his great peculiarity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starved hedge-sparrow haunts the moistened sink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On gurly winter days, the bitter wind<br /></span>

<p>On the twenty-seventh day of December
1806, at the collegiate town
of Tortosa in Catalonia, Maria Griño,
the wife of José Cabrera, an industrious
and respectable mariner, gave
birth to a son. Destined to the
church, this child, from his earliest
boyhood, was the petted favourite of
his family. His parents looked to him
as a staff and support for their declining
years, his sisters as a protector;
and none ventured to thwart his whims,
or correct the failings of the young
student. Thus abandoned to the dictates
of a disposition naturally perverse,
Ramon Cabrera led the life of
a vagabond, rather than that of a
scholar and of one destined to holy
orders. Avoided by the more respectable
of his classmates and townsmen,
he fell amongst evil associates, and
soon became notorious for precocity of
vice. The reprimands of his superiors,
the entreaties of his relatives, even
punishment and seclusion, were inefficacious
to reclaim him. Disliking
books, the sole use he made of opportunities
of study, was to imbibe the
abominable and sanguinary maxims
of the Inquisition. The taint of
Carlism, widely spread amongst the
clergy of the diocese of Tortosa,
whose bishop, Saenz, was an influential
and devoted member of the
apostolical party, was speedily contracted
by Cabrera. By character
and propensities better fitted for an
unscrupulous military partisan than
for a minister of the gospel, for a devouring
wolf than for a meek and
humble shepherd of God’s flock, no
sooner was the cry of insurrection
raised in the kingdom of Arragon than
he hastened to swell it with his voice.
On the 15th of November 1833 he
joined Colonel Carnicer, who had already
planted on the ramparts of
Morella the standard of Charles the
Fifth.</p>

<p>Six years have elapsed since the
termination of the civil war in Arragon
and Valencia, and we should
scarcely hope to interest English
readers by raking up its details. In
taking the volumes named at foot for
the subject of an article, our intention
is rather to give a correct notion of the
character of a man who by one party
has been extolled as a hero, by another
stigmatized as a savage. A
brief sketch of his career, and a few
personal anecdotes, will afford the best
means of deciding which of these
epithets he may with most justice
claim.</p>

<p>For the first sixteen months of the
war, Cabrera acted as subordinate to
Carnicer, chief of the Arragonese
Carlists; and during that time he in
no way distinguished himself, save by
occasional acts of cruelty. His presumption
and want of military knowledge
caused the loss of more than one
action—especially that of Mayals in
Catalonia, in which, as it was then
thought, the Arragonese faction received
its death-blow. This unlucky
encounter was followed by various
lesser ones, equally disastrous; and at
the commencement of 1835, the Carlist
chiefs in the eastern provinces of the
Peninsula were reduced to wander
in the mountains at the head of scanty
and disheartened bands, seeking
shelter from the Queen’s troops,
against whom they were totally unable
to make a stand. Furious at
this state of things, and still more so
at the conduct of Carnicer, to whose
lenity with the prisoners and population
he attributed their reverses, discontented
also with his obscure and
subaltern position, Cabrera, who represented
in Arragon the apostolical
or ultra-absolutist party, and who on
that account had influential supporters
at the court of Charles the Fifth, resolved
upon a bold attempt to get rid
of his chief and command in his stead.
Abandoning his post, he set out for
Navarre, in company with a clever
and resolute female of considerable
personal attractions, intended as a
propitiatory offering to the royal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
widower whose favour he was about
to solicit. On his arrival he obtained
a private audience of Don Carlos, to
whom he represented himself as capable
of commanding in Arragon, and
of achieving the triumph of the King’s
cause. He exposed his plan of campaign,
accused Carnicer of weakness
and mistaken humanity, and urged
the necessity of severe and sanguinary
measures. The result of his representations,
and of the pleadings of his
friends, some of whom were the Pretender’s
most esteemed counsellors,
was his return to Arragon, bearing a
despatch by which Carnicer was ordered
to make over his command to
Cabrera, and to present himself at
headquarters in Navarre. On the
ninth of March 1835, Cabrera assumed
the supreme command, and Carnicer,
in obedience to his instructions, set
out for the Basque country. On his
road he fell into the hands of the
Christinos, and was shot at Miranda
del Ebro.</p>

<p>Public opinion amongst the Carlists
unhesitatingly attributed to Cabrera
the death of his former superior.
Under pretence of their serving him as
guides, he had prevailed upon Carnicer
to take with him two officers
whom he pointed out. These were
also made prisoners; but although the
Eliot convention was not yet in existence,
and quarter was rarely given,
both of them were exchanged after a
very short delay. The information
received by the Christino authorities,
of the route that Carnicer was to follow,
was sent from the village of
Palomar on a day when Cabrera was
quartered there. Other circumstances
confirmed the suspicion of foul play,
and that Carnicer had been betrayed
by his own party; and so generally
was the treachery imputed to Cabrera,
that he at last took notice of the
charge, and used every means to check
its discussion. So long as a year
afterwards, he shot at Camarillas the
brother of one of the two officers who
had accompanied Carnicer, for having
been so imprudent as to say that the
latter had been sold by Cabrera.<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a>
Such severity produced, of course, a
directly opposite effect to that desired
by its author; for although Cabrera
pretexted other motives, its real ones
were evident, and all men remained
convinced of his guilt. Subsequently
the Carlist general Cabañero threw
the alleged calumny in his face in
presence of several persons, and instead
of repelling it with his sword,
Cabrera submitted patiently to the
imputation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> By a remarkable coincidence, this execution occurred on the
16th of February 1836, on the same day and at the very same hour that
Cabrera’s mother was shot at Tortosa. To this latter unfortunate and cruel
act, which has been absurdly urged as a justification of Cabrera’s atrocities,
further reference will presently be made.</p></div>

<p>Justly distrustful of those about
him, Carnicer, when passing the night
in the mountains, was wont to change
his sleeping place after all his companions
had retired to rest. On one
occasion, in the neighbourhood of
Alacon, a soldier who had lain down
upon the couch prepared for his general,
was assassinated by a pistol-shot.
Cabrera was in the encampment, and
although the perpetrator of the deed
was never positively known, rumour
laid the crime at his door. Whether
or not the dark suspicion was well
founded, the establishment of its justice
would scarcely add a shade of
blackness to the character of Ramon
Cabrera.</p>

<p>Already, during a period of eighteen
months, the kingdoms of Arragon and
Valencia had groaned beneath the
calamities of civil war. Their cattle
driven, their granaries plundered, their
sons dragged away to become unwilling
defenders of Don Carlos, the unfortunate
inhabitants could scarcely
conceive a worse state than that of
continual alarm and insecurity in
which they lived. They had yet to
learn that what they had hitherto endured
was light to bear, compared to
the atrocious system introduced by
the ruthless successor of Carnicer.
From the day that Cabrera assumed
the command, the war became a butchery,
and its inflictions ceased to be
confined to the armed combatants on
either side. Thenceforward, the infant
in the cradle, the bedridden old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
man, the pregnant matron, were included
amongst its victims. A mere
suspicion of liberal opinions, the possession
of a national guardsman’s
uniform, a glass of water given to a
wounded Christino, a distant relationship
to a partisan of the Queen, was
sentence of death. The rules of civilized
warfare were set at nought, and
Cabrera, in obedience to his sanguinary
instincts, committed his murders
not only when they might possibly
advance, but even when they must
positively injure, the cause of him
whom he styled his sovereign. “Those
days that I do not shed blood,” said
he, in July 1837, when waiting in the
ante-chamber of Don Carlos with
Villareal, Merino, Cuevillas, and other
generals, “I have not a good digestion.”
During the five years of his
command, his digestion can rarely
have been troubled.</p>

<p>The task of recording the exploits
and cruelties of Cabrera, and the history
of the war in which he took so
prominent a part, has been undertaken
by three Spaniards of respectability
and talent; the principal of
whom, Don Francisco Cabello, was
formerly political chief of the province
of Teruel, in the immediate vicinity of
Cabrera’s strongholds. There he had
abundant opportunities of gathering
information concerning the Carlist
leader. In the book before us he does
not confine himself to bare assertion,
but supplies an ample appendix of
justificatory documents, without which,
indeed, many of the atrocious facts
related would find few believers.</p>

<p>The Carlist troops in Arragon and
Valencia were of very different composition
from those in Navarre and
Biscay. In the latter provinces, an
intelligent and industrious peasantry
rose to defend certain local rights and
immunities, whose preservation, they
were taught to believe, was bound up
with the success of Don Carlos. In
Eastern Spain the mass of the respectable
and labouring classes were of
liberal opinions, and the ranks of the
faction were swelled by the dregs and
refuse of the population. Highwaymen
and smugglers, escaped criminals,
profligate monks, bad characters of
every description, banded together
under command of chiefs little better
than themselves, but who, by greater
energy, or from having a smattering
of military knowledge, gained an ascendancy
over their fellows. In these
motley hordes of reprobates, who,
after a time, schooled by experience
and defeat, were formed into regular
battalions, capable of contending,
with chances of success, against equal
numbers of the Queen’s troops, the
clergy played a conspicuous part.
Rare were the encounters between
Christinos and Carlists, in which
some sturdy friar did not lose his life
whilst heading and encouraging the
latter; after every action cowls and
breviaries formed part of the spoil;
scarce one of the rebel leaders but had
his clerical staff of chaplains, sharing
in, often stimulating, his cruelties and
excesses. Those monks who did not
openly take the field, busied themselves
in promoting disaffection
amongst the Queen’s partisans. The
most subversive sermons were daily
preached; the confessional became the
vehicle of insidious and treasonable
admonitions; the liberal section of the
clergy was subjected to cruel molestation
and injustice. All these circumstances,
added to the scandal and discord
that reigned in the convents,
loudly called for the suppression of
the latter. Not only the government,
which saw and suffered from the rebellion
so enthusiastically shared in
and promoted by the monks, but the
very founders of the orders, could
they have revisited Spain, would
have advised their abolition. The
following curious extract from the
book now under review gives a striking
picture of Spanish monastic doings
in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>“If, in the year 1835, St Bernard
could have accompanied us on our
visit to the monastery of Beruela in
the Moncayo, surely he would have
been indignant, and would have chastised
the monks; surely he himself
would have solicited the extinction of
his order. Out of thirty monks, very
few confessed, and only two or three
knew how to preach; every one
breakfasted and said mass just when
he thought proper; by nine in the
morning they might be seen wandering
about the neighbouring country and
gardens, or shooting small birds near the
gates of the monastery; at eleven, they
assembled in a cell to play <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">monté</i> with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
visitors from the neighbouring towns
and villages, winning and losing thousands
of reals. During dinner, instead
of having some grave and proper
book read aloud to them, one of
their number related obscene stories
for the amusement of his companions;
at dessert the finest wines were served,
the monks played upon the piano,
and sang indecent songs. The <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">siesta</i>
passed away the afternoon, until, towards
evening, these self-denying anchorites
roused themselves from their
slumbers, and resumed their favourite
amusements of birding and tale-telling.
At nightfall the green-cloth
was again spread, and the cards were in
full activity; sometimes six or eight of
the monks got upon their mules, and
rode a distance of two or three
leagues to a ball, dressed in the height
of the fashion. The writer of these
pages once asked the prior to let him
see the paintings executed by the
brotherhood; he was conducted to
the apartments of the abbot, and in
the most secluded of them was shown
a wretched daub, of which the subject
was shamefully coarse and disgusting.
* * * Many of the women of the
neighbouring village of Vera went by
the names of the monks; and so great
became the scandal, that, on one occasion,
when the national guards were
sent upon an expedition, the alcalde
issued an order prohibiting their wives
to walk in the direction of the monastery.
One woman, who disobeyed
the injunction, was made to pay a
fine, and narrowly escaped having her
head shaved in the public marketplace.”</p>

<p>The monks prosecuted the alcalde
for this abuse of authority; but in the
course of the trial so many scandalous
revelations were made concerning
them, that the over-zealous official
got off with a very light punishment.
His proclamation, the sentence of the
Audiencia of Saragossa, and some
other documents confirming the truth
of the above allegations against the
monastery, are given in the appendix
to Señor Cabello’s book. “Certainly,”
continues that gentleman, “all
monasteries were not like that of Beruela.
There were many virtuous,
enlightened, and laborious monks; but
if these were too numerous to be
styled the exceptions, they at any
rate composed the minority.”</p>

<p>To return to Cabrera. His first
act, upon assuming the supreme command,
was to collect the scattered
remnant of Carnicer’s faction, which
amounted but to three hundred infantry
and forty horsemen. With these
he commenced operations, limited at
first, owing to the scanty numbers of
his band, to marauding expeditions
amongst the villages, whence he retreated
to the mountains on the approach
of the Queen’s forces. His
cruelties soon made him universally
dreaded in the districts he
overran. To the militia especially he
gave no quarter, slaying them unmercifully,
wherever he could lay hands
upon them, even when they capitulated
on promise of good treatment.
He was seconded by Quilez, El Serrador,
Llangostera, and other partisans,
as desperate, and nearly as
bloodthirsty, as himself. With extraordinary
and stupid obstinacy, the
Madrid government persisted in treating
the Arragonese rebellion as unimportant;
and instead of at once
sending a sufficient force for its suppression,
allowed the insurgents to
gain ground, recruit their forces, capture
fortified places, and ravage the
country, setting at defiance the feeble
garrisons, and gallant but unavailing
efforts of the national guard.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September, at day-break,
Cabrera suddenly appeared in
the town of Rubielos de Mora. Believing
him far away, the garrison were
taken entirely by surprise, and after
a brief skirmish in the streets, retreated
to a fortified convent. Here
they made a vigorous defence, and no
efforts of the Carlists were sufficient
to dislodge them; until at dawn upon
the 12th, after a siege of twenty-four
hours, the Christinos perceived the
points of the assailants’ pickaxes
piercing the wall that divided the
convent from an adjoining house.
They set fire to the house, but unfortunately
a high wind fanned the
flames, which speedily communicated
to the convent. Even then the besieged
continued to defend themselves,
but at last, overcome by fatigue, hunger,
and thirst, scorched, bruised, and
exhausted, they accepted the terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
offered by the besiegers. Their lives
were to be spared, and they were to
retain their clothes and whatever property
they had about them. Cabrera
and Forcadell signed the agreement;
and sixty-five national guardsmen
and soldiers of the regiment of Ciudad
Real marched out of the burning
convent, and were escorted by the
Carlists in the direction of Nogueruelas.
On reaching a plain near that
town, known as the Dehesa, or Pasture,
Cabrera ordered a halt, that his
soldiers might eat their rations. The
prisoners also were supplied with food.
The meal over, the Carlist chief formed
his infantry and cavalry in a circle,
made the captives strip off every part
of their clothing, and bade them run.
No sooner did they obey his order,
than they were charged with lance
and bayonet, and slaughtered to a
man. It was a fine feast of blood for
Cabrera and his myrmidons. On the
body of one victim twenty-six wounds
were afterwards counted. When Cabrera
departed, the authorities of the
adjacent town buried the bodies; but
at the end of the war, in the year
1841, upon the anniversary of the
massacre, their remains were disinterred
and removed to Rubielos with
much pomp and religious ceremony.</p>

<p>Such were the pastimes of Cabrera,
such was the faith he kept with those
who confided in his word. The barbarous
execution detailed above was
one of many that occurred in the first
year of his command. Up to the
month of February 1836, the number
of his victims, slain after the battle,
in cold blood, often in defiance of capitulation,
sometimes on mere suspition
of liberalism, amounted to one
hundred and eighty-one. This does
not include murders committed on
the highways and in the mountains,
but those only of which there were
abundant witnesses, and that are
proved by dates and documents.
Amongst the slaughtered, were children
and old men. Two lads of sixteen
and seventeen years of age were
shot at Codoñera in presence of their
mother. When she implored Cabrera’s
mercy, he told her that her sons
should be spared if her husband would
give himself up and take their place.
On hearing this reply, worthy of a
Caligula or a Nero, the unhappy woman
swooned away, and the infant at
her breast fell dead from her arms as
if struck by lightning. The shock
to the mother had killed the child.
All these atrocities were committed
whilst Cabrera’s mother yet lived unmolested
in Tortosa.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Christino general
Nogueras, busied in the pursuit of the
rebels, passed his whole time in the
mountains, often not entering a town
for a month together, except to get
pay or shoes for his troops. Wherever
he went, he was assailed by the tears
and lamentations of bereaved wives
and mothers. If he paused at Calatayud,
they told him of the death of
nine national guards shot at Castejoncillo;
at Caspe, the weeping widows
and orphans of five others presented
themselves before him; at Teruel he
was horrified by the narrative of the
massacre of the Dehesa; when he
traversed the plains of Alpuente, the
Carrascal of Yesa, where forty prisoners
had been bayoneted, was pointed
out to his notice; in the Maestrazgo
he found universal mourning for sixty-one
nationals, pitilessly butchered at
Alcanar; in each hamlet where he
halted for the night, the authorities
complained to him of the most barbarous
ill-treatment at the hands of
Cabrera. Not a village did he pass
through, whose alcalde had not been
brutally bastinadoed. From his companions,
his visitors, his guides, he
heard continually of Cabrera’s cruelties.
In the whole district nothing,
else was talked of. The sole thought
of the liberal party was how to put a
period to them, and to be avenged
upon their perpetrator. The most
humane and peaceable men urged a
system of reprisals, as both legitimate
and likely to be efficacious. Such a
system, Nogueras, yielding to the public
voice, and enraged at the murder of
two alcaldes, whom Cabrera had causelessly
shot, at last resolved to adopt.
He demanded the execution of Cabrera’s
mother, in the vain hope that it
would strike terror into the rebel chief,
and check his excesses. Most unhappy
was the impulse to which he yielded.
The act itself was cruel and hasty; its
consequences were terrible. But such
was the state of feeling in Arragon at
that time, that, until those consequences
were felt, many approved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
deed. The captain-general of Arragon,
Don Francisco Serrano, a man
noted for humanity and mildness,
deemed the measure advisable, and
even announced it with satisfaction in
a proclamation, by which he declared
a similar fate to be in reserve for Cabrera’s
sisters, and for the relatives of
the other rebel chiefs, if the Carlists
persisted in their atrocities. Hitherto
the whole odium of the fate of a forlorn
old woman, who perhaps deplored
as much as any one the enormities
committed by her son, has rested
upon Nogueras. This is hardly fair.
Ill-advised, and in a moment of just
irritation, he urged a request, too
hastily complied with, speedily repented,
and which, according to the
conviction of Señor Cabello, he would
himself have retracted had he not been
absent from Tortosa when its accomplishment
took place. A more unfortunate
act, to whomsoever it may
chiefly be imputed, could not have
been devised. It was at once repudiated
by the Spanish government,
by the Cortes and the nation. In
the eyes of Europe, it went far to convert
Cabrera from a pitiless butcher
into an injured victim. At a distance
from the theatre of war, the nine score
unfortunates whom he had massacred
in cold blood were forgotten or overlooked.
Pity for the mother’s fate
procured oblivion for the previous
crimes of the son. Filial affection
and regret, working upon an impassioned
nature, were urged in extenuation
of his subsequent excesses. His
massacres became holocausts, offered
by a pious child to the manes of a
murdered parent.</p>

<p>In Valderobles, on the 20th of February,
Cabrera received intelligence
of his mother’s death. Its first result
was a ferocious proclamation, by an
article of which he decreed the death
of four women, one of them the lady
of a Christino colonel, then in his
power. Had he shot them at once,
in the first heat of anger and heaviness
of grief, the act, however barbarous
and severe, would have been palliated
by circumstances; but for seven days
he dragged those unfortunate women
with him on all his marches, compelling
them to wander barefoot over
the rugged Mountains of Arragon. So
great were the sufferings of these poor
creatures, that even Cabrera’s aides-de-camp,
albeit not very tender-hearted,
interceded for them with their chief.
At last, on the 27th February, having
returned to Valderobles, three of the
women were released from their misery
by a violent death. This execution
was followed by many others. Seven
and twenty national guards, taken
prisoners at Liria, were kept alive for
two or three days, and then massacred
at Chiva. On the 17th of April, the
ferryman of Olva, who acted as spy
to Cabrera, and who was shot after
the war, in the year 1841, brought
information to the Carlist camp that
two companies of Christino soldiers,
quartered in the hamlet of Alcotas,
kept but a careless watch, and might
easily be surprised. Cabrera immediately
set out, the ferryman acting
as guide, and fell upon the Christinos
before they were aware of his approach.
They defended themselves bravely;
but their ammunition being expended,
and themselves surrounded, they capitulated
on promise of quarter. Cabrera’s
chaplain, Father Escorihuela,
was the person who prevailed on them
to surrender, solemnly assuring them
that their lives should be spared. A
few hours later, this same priest heard
the confession of the officers previously
to their execution. To the soldiers,
even the last consolations of religion
were refused. Unshriven, they were
shot to the last man.</p>

<p>But enough of such sanguinary
details. Notwithstanding a severe
defeat sustained a short time previously
at Molina, Cabrera, in the
spring of 1836, found himself at the
head of four thousand infantry and
three hundred dragoons. He displayed
extraordinary activity; improved the
organisation of his forces, and put
them upon the footing of a regular
army. Owing to these ameliorations,
and to the culpable negligence of the
Spanish government, who left the
Army of the Centre unprovided with
the commonest necessaries for campaigning,
he was now able to abandon
his former haunts in the mountains of
Beceite, and to advance into the open
country. Seeing the necessity of a
stronghold for his stores and hospitals,
and as a place of refuge in case of a
reverse, he fixed upon the town of
Cantavieja, which, from its size, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
strength of its walls, its central position
in the territory of his operations,
and especially from the difficulty of
bringing artillery over the steep and
bad roads leading to it, was peculiarly
suited to his purpose. He set to work
to fortify it; and in spite of the representations
made to the Madrid government
by the inhabitants of the province,
who foresaw the evils that would accrue
to them from its fortification, he
was allowed, without interruption or
molestation, to put it in a state of
defence. The energy and skill exhibited
by him at this period were
wonderfully great, and would have
done honour to an older soldier. He
formed capacious hospitals, and vast
depots for food and other stores;
established powder manufactories, and
workshops for armourers and tailors;
and leaving a strong garrison in the
place, again took the field.</p>

<p>Some sharp fighting now occurred,
and the Christinos had the worst of
it in several encounters; until at last
the minister of war, roused from his
apathy, sent strong reinforcements
to Arragon and Valencia. Amongst
others, General Narvaez, at the head
of a brilliant brigade, was detached
from the army of the north, and after
a rapid march of nine days, during
which he crossed nearly the whole
north-eastern corner of Spain from
the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean,
arrived at Teruel, and commenced
operations with an activity
that inspired the Arragonese with
fresh hopes of a prompt termination
of the war. He was in the field, and
hard upon the heels of a Carlist corps
commanded by a chief known as the
Organist, when an orderly, bearing
despatches from Madrid, came up at
speed. “Yonder rebels,” said Narvaez,
after reading his letters, and
pointing to the enemy, “may truly
say that they exist by royal order.”
The despatches directed him instantly
to quit Arragon, and pursue
Gomez, who had left Biscay on his
celebrated expedition to the southern
provinces of Spain.</p>

<p>It is significant of the little estimation
in which Cabrera was held
by the generals of the Navarrese and
Biscayan faction, that when Gomez,
finding himself hard pressed by the
Queen’s troops, sent to Arragon for
assistance, he did not address himself
to Cabrera, who commanded in chief
in that province, but to Quilez and
El Serrador, subordinate partisans.
Nevertheless Cabrera joined him, not
with a body of troops, but accompanied
only by his aides-de-camp and
staff, and by one of his clerical mentors,
the canon Cala y Valcarcel.
Gomez treated him with great contempt,
and would give him no command
in his division; but he still
continued with him, and was present
at the defeat of Villarrobledo, where
Diego Leon with his hussars routed
Gomez, taking the whole of his baggage,
twelve hundred prisoners, and
two thousand muskets. When the
Carlists occupied Cordova, Cabrera
was one of the first men in the town,
which he entered with a handful of
cavalry, under the command of Villalobos,
to whom he had attached himself,
and who was killed by a shot
fired from a window. If Gomez disliked
Cabrera, Cabrera, on his side,
heartily despised Gomez. To have
captured three thousand national
guardsmen in Cordova, and not to
have shot at least a couple of thousands
of them—to have spared the
fifteen hundred men composing the
garrison of Almaden, were inexcusable
weaknesses in the eyes of the
Arragonese leader. Moreover, his
name was omitted in the despatches
and proclamations announcing the
triumphs of the division; and at this
he was indignant, viewing it as a stain
upon his reputation, and a dishonour
to his rank. At last, so troublesome
did he become, constantly murmuring
at whatever was done, and even conspiring
to promote mutiny amongst
the men, that Gomez, in order not to
shoot him, which he otherwise would
have been compelled to do, insisted
upon their parting company. On the
3d of November, Cabrera, with his
staff, orderlies, and a small escort,
set out for the mountains of Toledo.
His numbers increased by the accession
of some parties of Carlist cavalry,
picked up on the road, he passed
through La Mancha, and made for
the Ebro, intending to visit Don
Carlos at Oñate. But whilst seeking
a ford, he was surprised by the
cavalry of Irribarren. The lances of
Leon and the sabres of Buenvenga<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
made short work of it with the astonished
rebels. Cabrera and a handful
of men escaped, and only paused at
midnight, when exhausted by their
long flight, in the village of Arévalo.
Scarcely had they taken up their
quarters, when a column of Christino
infantry dashed into the place, bayoneting
all before them. Unacquainted
with the localities, Cabrera wandered
about the streets, seeking an
exit; and finally, favoured by the
darkness, and after receiving a stab
from a knife, and another from a
bayonet, he succeeded in escaping to
the neighbouring forest. Here he
was found by one of his officers, who
conveyed him to the house of a village
priest, named Moron, where he
was concealed and taken care of till
his wounds were healed. At the
commencement of 1837 he found himself
well enough to travel, and started
for Arragon, escorted by a squadron
of cavalry and a few light infantry,
whom he had sent for from the
Maestrazgo. But he had been tracked
by Christino spies, and Señor Cabello,
then political chief of Teruel, had information
of his route. This he communicated
to the military governor,
an old and dilatory officer, who moved
out with a small body of troops, intending
to surprise Cabrera at Camañas,
one of his halting places, and
hoping to gain in the field the promotion
which he would have done
better to have awaited within the
walls of his citadel. At a village,
four hours’ march from Camañas, he
paused, and wasted a day in sending
out spies to ascertain the movements
of the enemy. His emissaries at last
returned; but only to tell him that
Cabrera had rested at Camañas from
ten in the morning till one in the
afternoon, and had then continued his
journey, travelling in a wretched carriage,
and escorted by a hundred
sleepy infantry, and as many horsemen,
whose beasts were unshod, and
half dead with fatigue. It was too
late to pursue; and thus, owing to
the sluggishness and incapacity of
this officer, Cabrera escaped, probably
without knowing it, from one of
the greatest risks he had yet run.</p>

<p>The disastrous result of the various
expeditions which, under Gomez,
Garcia, and others, had left the
Basque provinces for the interior of
Spain, had not yet convinced Don
Carlos that his cause was unpopular.
Deceived by his flatterers, who assured
him that his appearance would
every where be the signal for a general
uprising in his favour, he crossed
the Ebro in the month of May with
sixteen battalions and nine squadrons.
Victorious at Huesca, at Gra, in
Catalonia, his army was utterly routed
by the Baron de Meer and Diego
Leon; and his sole thought then
became how to recross the Ebro, and
take refuge at Cantavieja, under the
wing of his faithful Cabrera. Orders
were sent to the latter chief to come
and meet his sovereign. He obeyed,
and by his assistance the passage of
the river was accomplished. It was
shortly before this time that Cabrera,
whilst witnessing the conflagration
of a village set on fire by his command,
was struck by lightning, which
killed one of his aides-de-camp, and
threw him senseless from his horse.
At first it was thought that he also
was dead; but bleeding restored him,
and the next day he was again in
the saddle, burning, plundering, and
shooting. His atrocities at this period
surpass belief, and are too horrible
to recapitulate. The curious in
such matters may find them set down
in all their hideous details, in the
pages of Señor Cabello. Whether on
account of his cruelties, or of his other
bad qualities, most of the Carlist generals
in Arragon about this time refused
to act with him, and even loaded
him with abuse. Cabañero actually
challenged him to fight—a challenge
which he did not think proper to
accept. The same chief repeatedly
told Don Carlos that he would rather
serve as a private soldier in the army
of Navarre than as a general under
the orders of Cabrera. Quilez, who
hated Cabrera as the assassin of his
friend and countryman Carnicer,
published an address to the Arragonese
troops, calling upon them to leave
the standard of the vile, dissolute,
and cowardly Catalonian who disgraced
them by his cruelties. He invited
their attention to the ruined and
miserable condition of their province
since Cabrera had commanded there,
and urged them to petition Don Carlos
to give them a general more worthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
of defending his rights and leading
them to victory. So high did the
quarrel run, and so widely did it spread,
that the Arragonese and Catalonian
battalions were near coming to blows.
Don Carlos supported Cabrera, and
Quilez and Cabañero, with their divisions,
separated themselves from the
army, and went to make war elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the month of July there were
forty thousand infantry and four
thousand cavalry in the province of
Teruel; for nearly four years the
district had been devastated and plundered
by the Carlists, and the harvest
was not yet ripe. Under these circumstances
the troops were half-starved.
The Carlist soldiers received
no bread and only half rations
of meat. Even in the towns, and for
ready money, provisions were unobtainable.
The Conde de Luchana,
who then commanded the Christinos,
did all that general could do, more
than could be expected of any commander—all,
in short, that he was
wont to do, when the opportunity offered,
for the cause of liberty and of
his Queen. Thinking that the surrounding
country would not supply
rations because the impoverished government
could not pay cash for them,
he drew upon his private funds, and
sent a commissioner with large sums
of money to Teruel, to purchase all
the corn that could be obtained. This
was so little that it did not yield two
days’ rations to each soldier. At last
Espartero and his division were summoned
to the defence of Madrid, then
menaced by Zaratiegui. During his
absence occurred the action of Herrera,
in which General Buerens, greatly
outnumbered, was defeated with
considerable loss. But this reverse
was soon revenged. Encouraged by
their recent success, Don Carlos and
Cabrera approached Madrid by forced
marches. Their movements had been
so eccentric and rapid that they had
thrown most of the Christino generals
off the scent. Espartero was an exception.
After driving away Zaratiegui,
he had returned to Arragon.
He now hurried back to Madrid, and
entered its gates a few hours after
the arrival of the Pretender within
sight of that city, amidst the acclamations
of the national guards,
who, until then, formed the sole
garrison of the capital. Don Carlos
retired, Espartero followed, came
up with him on the 19th of September,
and so mauled his army that he
entirely gave up his mad project of
establishing himself in Madrid, sent
Cabrera back to Arragon, and scampered
off in the direction of the Basque
provinces. He was followed up by
Espartero and Lorenzo, overtaken
and beaten at Covarubbias and at
Huerta del Rey, and finally entered
Biscay in lamentable plight, his illusions
dissipated, his hopes of one day
sitting upon the throne of his ancestors
entirely destroyed. Five months
had elapsed since he left Navarre,
and strange had been their vicissitudes.
Surrounded in Sanguesa by
bishops, ministers, generals, and courtiers,
in Espejo a handful of <i>Chapel-churris</i>
were his sole defenders. Enthroned
and almost worshipped at
Huesca in the mountains of Bronchales
he had been glad to accept the
support and guidance of a shepherd.
One day holding a levee, the
next he was unable to write a letter
in safety. At Barbastro he bestowed
places and honours upon his adherents;
at El Pobo he had not wherewith
to reward the servants who
waited on him. Strange transitions,
bitterly felt! By the failure of the
expedition all his prospects were
blighted. A loan, and his recognition
by the Northern powers, both
promised him contingently on his
entering Madrid, were now more remote
than ever. That nothing might
be wanting to the discomfiture of this
ill-starred prince, even the hypocrisy
of his character was discovered and
exposed. Several of his letters to
the Princess of Beira were intercepted
by General Oraa, and published in
the Spanish newspapers. Although
written by one professedly so devout
and austere, their contents were both
trivial and licentious.</p>

<p>The year 1838 opened disastrously
for the Christinos. The strong town
and fort of Morella fell into the hands
of Cabrera. Situated on a hill in the
valley formed by the highest sierras
of the Maestrazgo, and at the point of
junction of Arragon, Catalonia, and
Valencia, difficult of approach, and
protected by defiles and rivers, chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
town of a corregimiento or department,
and possessing considerable
wealth both agricultural and manufacturing,
it was, of all others, the
place most coveted by the Carlists.
For a long time previously to its capture,
an officer of the faction, Paul Alio
by name, had been entrusted with its
blockade. His orders were to employ
every possible means to win over
the garrison or accomplish a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup
de main</i>. Various attempts had
proved unsuccessful, when, at the
moment that he least expected it, he
was suddenly enabled to accomplish
his objects. An artilleryman, a deserter
from the castle, offered to scale
the walls with twenty men, to surprise
the sentinel upon the platform,
and subsequently the whole guard.
The idea was caught at; ladders were
made according to the measure which
the traitor had brought of the exact
height of the walls, and on the dark
and rainy night of the 25th January
a party of Carlists crept up the hill,
planted and climbed the ladders,
stabbed the sentry, who was asleep
in his box, overcame the guard, and
fired upon the town. In vain did the
unfortunate governor, Don Bruno
Portillo, endeavour to make his way
into the fort; he was repulsed and
wounded, and before morning he and
the remains of the garrison were compelled
to abandon Morella. Although
an old and respected officer, he was
accused of treachery, or at least of
want of vigilance. The latter might
perhaps be imputed to him, but there
appear to have been no sufficient
grounds for the former charge. Eager
to wash out the stain upon his reputation,
he returned to Morella, when
General Oraa made his unsuccessful
attack upon it a few months later, and
died leading the forlorn-hope, the first
man upon the breach.</p>

<p>The capture of Morella was a great
triumph for Cabrera, whose chief
stronghold it became. It assured
him the dominion of a large and fertile
tract of country. From its towers,
lofty though they were, the banner of
Isabella the Second could nowhere be
descried, save on the coasts of the
Mediterranean and the distant banks
of the Ebro. The termination of the
war seemed less likely than ever.</p>

<p>It was about a month after the
surprise of Morella, that General
Cabañero, encouraged by the recent
success of his party, eager for distinction,
and perhaps jealous of Cabrera’s
reputation, attempted the most daring
and dashing enterprise of the whole
war. He conceived the hope of capturing
in one night, and with three
thousand men, a fortress that had
defended itself for two months against
the best generals of Napoleon, backed
by seventy thousand veterans, and a
hundred pieces of artillery. The
capital of Arragon, the heroic city of
Saragossa, was the high game at
which Cabañero ventured to fly. Had
he succeeded, he would have commanded
the Ebro and the communication
between Navarre and Catalonia,
and might have installed Don Carlos
in the palace of Alonzo the Fifth, and
of Ferdinand the Catholic. Making
one march from Alloza, a distance of
four-and-twenty hours, he arrived late
at night in the environs of Saragossa.
Provided with ladders by the owner
of a neighbouring country-house, who
was in his confidence, he caused a
few soldiers to scale the wall, and
open the gate of the Virgin de la
Carmen, through which he marched.
Some <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">vivas</i> given for Cabañero and
Carlos Quinto roused the nearest
inhabitants, and preserved the main
guard from a surprise. Shots were
fired, and the alarm spread. By
this time Cabañero was far into
the town, posting his battalions in
the squares and open places. In
every street the Carlist drums were
beating, and several houses were
broken open and entered. It was a
terrible moment for the inhabitants of
Saragossa. Startled from their sleep,
without chiefs to direct or previous
plan to guide them, none knew what
measures to adopt. Some few ran to
the public squares, and were taken
prisoners; but the majority, recovering
from their first panic, adopted the
best and surest means of ridding the
city of the unexpected foe. In an
instant every window was thrown
open, and bristled with the muskets of
the national guards. They could not
be confident of victory, for they were
totally ignorant of the number of their
enemies; but if the triumph was to
be for the latter, the Sargossans were
determined that it should cost them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
dear. When the much-wished-for daylight
appeared, the battle ceased to be
from the balconies; the nationals, and
about two hundred soldiers of various
regiments who happened to be in the
town, descended to the streets, and
after a sharp but short struggle, drove
out the daring intruders. The loss
of the Carlists was a thousand men,
inclusive of seven hundred prisoners;
that of the Saragossans amounted to
about one hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>Various strange incidents occurred
during this night-attack. A French
writer who visited Arragon during
the civil war, relates an anecdote of
two drummers who came up with
each other at midnight in the streets
of Saragossa, both plying their sticks
with extraordinary vigour, but to very
different tunes.</p>

<p>“Why do you beat the chamade?”
demanded one.</p>

<p>“Why do you beat to arms?” retorted
the other.</p>

<p>“I obey my orders.”</p>

<p>“And I mine.”</p>

<p>At that moment a passing lantern
lit up the Carlist boina of the one,
and the blue national guard’s uniform
of the other. The drummers stared
at each other for a moment, and then,
instead of drawing their swords and
setting to, which one would have
thought the most natural course to
adopt, they continued their march
side by side, each indulging in his
own particular rub-a-dub. The rights
of the sheepskin were mutually respected.</p>

<p>The results of Cabañero’s attack
were a cross of honour conferred upon
the national guards, who had made
so gallant a defence, and the death of
the governor, Esteller, who was assassinated
by the populace two days
afterwards. His conduct during the
fight had been marked by extreme
weakness, and even cowardice. He
entirely lost his presence of mind,
could give no orders, and remained
shut up in his house in spite of all the
efforts of his aides-de-camp and secretaries
to get him out into the street.
He would not even allow his servants
and orderlies to fire from the balconies,
and his windows were the only ones
in Saragossa that continued closed
during that eventful night. The next
day he was imprisoned, and it was intended
to bring him to trial; but on the
following morning a mob composed of
the lowest of the people repaired to his
place of confinement, brought him out
into the streets and there murdered him.
At the time the delinquents remained
unpunished, but seven years later, in
1845, the sons of Esteller revived the
affair, and procured the condemnation
to ten years’ galleys of one Chorizo,
the leader of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">marranos</i>, or lazzaroni
of Saragossa. Chorizo, literally
Sausage, whose real name was Melchior
Luna, was a butcher by trade,
and a sort of popular demagogue
amongst the lower orders of his fellow
citizens. But according to Señor
Cabello, his condemnation was unjust;
and instead of sharing in the murder
of Esteller, he had done his utmost to
protect him, even risking his own life
to save that of the unfortunate governor.
After a lapse of seven years
it was difficult to get at the real facts
of the case; and the chief effect of the
trial has been to publish the pusillanimity
of General Esteller, concerning
which the people of Saragossa had
previously observed a generous silence.</p>

<p>On the 1st of October 1838, the
Christino general Pardinas, with five
battalions and a regiment of cavalry,
encountered Cabrera near the town of
Maella. The forces were about equal
on either side, and at first the Christinos
had the advantage. But Pardinas
having thrown his left too forward,
it was cut off and surrounded. Without
waiting for help from the centre
and right wing, the battalions fell into
confusion and surrendered themselves
prisoners, thereby grievously compromising
the remainder of the division.
Astounded at the sudden loss of one
third of his force, Pardinas made desperate
efforts to preserve order; but all
was in vain, and his heroic efforts and
example served but to procure him an
honourable death, thereby saving him
the pain of reporting the most unfortunate
and disgraceful action of the
whole war. More than three-fifths
of the division were killed or taken
prisoners. The fate of the latter could
not be doubtful, for Cabrera was their
captor. Whilst still on the field of
battle, with the groans of the wounded
and dying sounding in his ears, he
sent an order to Major Espinosa to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
kill a number of dragoons of the regiment
del Rey, whom he had made
prisoners. Espinosa replied, that, the
action once over, he had forgotten
how to use his lance. Cabrera, however,
had little difficulty in finding a
more pliant agent. The unhappy
dragoons were stripped naked and
bayoneted: Espinosa was deprived of
his command and of future opportunities
of distinction. The same afternoon
Cabrera shot twenty-seven
wounded, in hospital at Maella.
Amongst his prisoners were ninety-six
sergeants. These he crammed
into a dark and narrow dungeon, and
after a few days, proposed to them to
take service in the rebel army. They
all refused, and one of them imprudently
added, “Sooner die than serve with
robbers.” These words were reported
to Cabrera, and he sought to discover
the man who had uttered them; but
although the other ninety-four well
knew who it was, no menaces could
induce them to betray their comrade.
Any one but Cabrera would have been
touched by such courage and constancy,
but he only found in it a pretext
for murder. The ninety-six sergeants
were shot at Horcayo. Similar
enormities now followed in rapid
succession; until the exasperation
in Saragossa and Valencia became
extreme, and the inhabitants tumultuously
assembled, demanding reprisals.
These it was not safe to
refuse. General Mendez Vigo, commanding
at Valencia, and who ventured
to deny them, was shot in the
streets. Juntas were formed, and
Carlist prisoners were executed. One
of these unfortunates, when marching
to his doom, was heard to exclaim,
“Not to the people of Valencia, but
to the infamous Cabrera, do I ascribe
my death.” There was a great outcry
made at the time, especially by
persons who knew nothing of the real
facts of the case, concerning these reprisals,
which were in fact unavoidable.
Cabrera’s atrocities had reached
such a pitch, that disaffection was
widely spreading in Arragon and Valencia.
The people, finding themselves
constantly in mourning for the death
of some near relative, murdered by his
orders, murmured against the government
which could not protect them,
and accused their rulers of Carlism
and treachery, of cowardice and indifference.
There was danger, almost a
certainty indeed, of an insurrection,
in which every Carlist prisoner and a
vast number of innocent persons would
inevitably have been sacrificed. Cabrera
would listen to no proposals for
exchanges, but persisted in shooting
all who fell into his hands. Without
reckoning the innumerable captives
dead from hunger and cruel treatment,
or those murdered on the march and in
the Carlist depots, but counting only
such as were shot and stabbed before
witnesses, Cabrera had killed, previously
to his mother’s death, one hundred
and eighty-one soldiers and nationals;
and seven hundred and thirty
subsequently to that event, and up to
the 1st of November 1838. His subalterns
had slain three hundred and
seventy more, making a total of twelve
hundred and eighty. Under these
circumstances, there was nothing for
it but a system of retaliation. This,
General Van Halen and the juntas
adopted, and after a very short time
the good effect was manifest. The
imprecations of the Carlist prisoners,
and the murmurs of his party, reached
the ears of Cabrera in tones so menacing,
that he was compelled to listen.
The treaty for exchange of prisoners
and cessation of reprisals, signed by
him and Van Halen, caused much
discontent amongst the coffeehouse
politicians of the Puerta del Sol; but
those who had experience of the war,
and who dwelt in its district, appreciated
the firmness of the Christino
general, as well as the docility and
true dignity with which he signed the
honourable name of a brave soldier
beside that of the assassin Count of
Morella.</p>

<p>Anticipating an attack upon the
fort of Segura, to whose possession he
attached great importance, Cabrera
took measures for its defence. For
this, if the inhabitants of the town
did not unite in it, a very large garrison
was necessary. Cabrera endeavoured,
therefore, by great promises,
to win over the townspeople, menacing
them at the same time with the
destruction of their town if they did
not comply with his wishes. They
held a meeting, and its result was a
declaration that they would never
take up arms against the Queen, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
that sooner than do so, they would
submit to be driven from their dwellings,
and become wanderers in the
woods. Cabrera took them at their
word, and in a few days the plough
might have passed over the site of
Segura. The magnificent church, the
public edifices, and three hundred and
fifty houses, were razed to the ground.
The castle alone was preserved. The
inhabitants themselves had been compelled
to accomplish the work of destruction;
and when that was done,
sixteen hundred men, women, and
children emigrated to the neighbouring
villages, or took shelter in the
caves and hollows of the pine forests.
In this circumstance, it is hard to say
which is most striking, the barbarity
of the destroyer, or the courageous
patriotism of the victims. The expected
siege of the castle soon followed,
but the inclemency of the
weather compelled Van Halen to
raise it. He was removed from the
command, and Nogueras, who was to
succeed him, being attacked by illness,
the army in Arragon remained
for a while without a competent chief.
Cabrera took advantage of this, prosecuted
the war with great activity
and vigour, and captured some fortified
places. Amongst others, he laid
siege to Montalban, which was desperately
defended for fifty days. At
the end of that time, the town being
reduced to ruins, the garrison and inhabitants
evacuated it, and retired to
Saragossa. During the siege, there
occurred a trait worthy of Cabrera.
The medicines for the wounded being
expended, the colonel of the national
guards spoke from the walls to the
Carlist general, and begged permission
to send to the nearest village for
a fresh supply. There were many
wounded Carlists in the town hospital,
and it was expected, therefore,
that the request would be granted.
Cabrera refused it, but, feigning compassion,
advised Vicente to hoist a
flag upon the hospital, that it might
be respected by the besiegers’ artillery.
The flag was hoisted, and instantly
became a mark for every gun
the Carlists had. In the course of
that day, sixty-six shells fell into the
hospital, killing many of the wounded,
and, amongst others, thirteen Carlist
prisoners. During this siege, a young
woman, two-and-twenty years of age,
Manuela Cirugeda by name, emulous
of the example of the Maid of Saragossa,
served as a national guard, and
fought most valiantly, until incapacitated
by illness, the result of her fatigues
and exertions.</p>

<p>Were it his only crime, Cabrera’s
treatment of his prisoners in the dungeons
of Morella, Benifasa, and other
places, would suffice to brand him
with eternal infamy. From the commencement
of the war till he was
driven out of the country, twelve
thousand soldiers and two thousand
national guards fell into his hands.
Half of the first named, and two-thirds
of the latter, died of hunger, ill treatment,
and of the diseases produced by
the stifling atmosphere of their prisons,
by the bad quality of their food, and
the state of general destitution in
which they were left. Those who
bore up against their manifold sufferings
only regained their liberty to
enter an hospital, incapacitated for further
military service. It took months
to rid them of the dingy, copper-coloured
complexion acquired in their
damp and filthy prisons, and some of
them never lost it. When the prisoners
taken in the action of Herrera
arrived at Cantavieja, they were barefooted,
and for sole raiment many had
but a fragment of matting, wherewith
to cover their nakedness, and defend
themselves from the weather. They
were thrust into a convent, and no
one was allowed to communicate with
them: even mothers, who anxiously
strove to convey a morsel of bread to
their starving sons, were pitilessly
driven away. Sick and squalid, they
were marched off to Beceite, and on
the road more than two hundred
were murdered. Those who paused
or sat down, overcome by fatigue,
were disposed of with the bayonet;
some fainted from exhaustion, and
had their heads crushed with large
stones, heaped upon them by their
guards. The muleteers, who compassionately
lent their beasts to the
wounded or dying, were unmercifully
beaten. On reaching Beceite, the
daily ration of each prisoner was two
ounces of raw potatoes. After repeated
entreaties of the inhabitants
they were at last allowed to leave
their prison by detachments, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
to clean the streets; and by this means
they were enabled to receive the assistance
which the very poorest of the
people stinted themselves and their
children to afford them. In spite of
the prohibitions of the Carlist authorities,
bread, potatoes, and maize ears
were thrown into the streets for their
relief. But even of these trifling supplies
they were presently deprived,
for an epidemic broke out amongst
them, and they were forbidden to
leave their prison lest they should
communicate it to the troops. Will
it be believed that in a Christian
country, and within the last ten years,
men were reduced to such extremities
as to devour the dead bodies of their
companions? Such was the case. It
has been printed fifty times, and hundreds
of living witnesses are ready to
attest it. When the Carlist colonel
Pellicer, the savage under whose eyes
these atrocities occurred, discovered
the horrible means by which his
wretched captives assuaged the pangs
of hunger, he became furious, caused
the prisoners to be searched, and shot
and bayoneted those who had preserved
fragments of their frightful
meal. The poor creatures thus condemned
marched to death with joy
and self-gratulation; those who remained
accused themselves of a similar
crime, and entreated that they
also might be shot. Twelve hundred
entered the prison; two hundred left
it; and of these, thirty were massacred
upon the road because they
were too weak to march. In the appendix
to his book, Señor Cabello
gives the diary of a survivor, an
officer of the regiment of Cordova. The
cruelties narrated in it exceed belief.
They are nevertheless confirmed by unimpeachable
evidence. The following
extract is from a document dated
the 20th of March 1844, and signed
by fifteen respectable inhabitants of
Beceite.</p>

<p>“During the abode of the said
prisoners in this town, each day twelve
or fourteen of them died from hunger
and misery. It was frequently observed,
when they were conveyed
from the prison to the cemetery, that
some of them still moved, and made
signs with their hands not to bury
them; some even uttered words, but
all in vain—<em>dead or alive, those who
once left the prison were buried</em>, and
only one instance was known of the
contrary occurring. The chaplain of
a Carlist battalion had gone to the
burying-ground to see if the graves
were deep enough, and whilst standing
there, <em>one of a pile of corpses
pulled him by the coat</em>. This attracted
his attention, and he had the man
carried to the hospital. * * *
There would be no end to our narrative
if we were to give a detailed account
of the sufferings of these prisoners;
so great were they, as at last to
shock even the commandant of the
depot, Don Juan Pellicer, who was
heard to exclaim more than once <em>that
he wished somebody would blow out his
brains, for he was sick of beholding so
much misery and suffering</em>. The few
inhabitants who remained in the town
behaved well, and notwithstanding
that the Carlists robbed them of all
they had, and that it was made a
crime to help the prisoners, they managed
in secret to give them some
relief, especially to the officers. The
facts here set down are true and certain,
and of them more than a hundred
eyewitnesses still exist.”</p>

<p>When the war in Biscay and
Navarre was happily concluded by
the convention of Vergara, the Duke
de la Victoria invited Cabrera to
follow the example of the other Carlist
generals, offering to him and to
the rebel troops under his command
the same terms that had been conceded
to those in the Basque provinces.
But the offer, generous though it was,
and undeserved by men who had
made war like savages rather than as
Christians, was contemptuously spurned.
Those best acquainted with the
character of Cabrera, were by no
means surprised at the refusal. They
foresaw that he would redouble his
atrocities, and only yield to brute force.
These anticipations were in most respects
realised.</p>

<p>In the months of October 1839,
Espartero, with the whole army of
the North, consisting of forty thousand
infantry, three thousand cavalry, and
the corresponding artillery, entered
lower Arragon. Anxious to economise
the blood of his countrymen,
trusting that Cabrera would open his
eyes to the inutility of further resistance,
confiding also, in some degree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
in the promises of certain Carlist
chiefs included in the treaty of Vergara,
and who expected by their influence
to bring over large bodies of
the rebels, the Duke de la Victoria
remained inactive during the winter,
merely blockading the Carlists within
their lines. Meanwhile Cabrera, debilitated
by six years of anxiety and
agitation, and by the dissolute life he
had led from a very early age, and
preyed upon by vexation and rage
occasioned him by the convention of
Vergara, fell seriously ill, and for
some time his life was in peril. Contrary
to expectation, he recovered;
but sickness or reflection had unmanned
him, and it is certain that in his
last campaign he displayed little talent
and less courage. Not so his subordinates.
The Arragonese Carlists
fought like lions, and the final triumph
of the Queen’s army and of their distinguished
leader was not achieved
without a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>The first appearance of spring was
the signal of action for the Christinos.
Even before the inclement season had
entirely passed away, in the latter
days of February 1840, Espartero
attacked Segura. One day’s well-directed
cannonade knocked the fort
about the ears of the garrison, and in
spite of the proverb, <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Segura serà
segura, ó de Ramon Cabrera sepultura</i>,
the place capitulated. The defence
of Castellote was longer, and extraordinarily
obstinate. Pelted with shot
and shell, the walls mined and blown
up and reduced to ruins, its garrison,
with a courage worthy of a better
cause, still refused to surrender, hoisted
a black banner in sign of no quarter,
and received a flag of truce with
a volley. The position of the castle,
on the summit of a steep and rugged
rock, rendered it almost impossible to
form a column of attack and take it
by assault. At last, however, this
was attempted, and after a desperate
combat of an hour’s duration, and
great loss on the part of the assailants,
the latter established themselves in a
detached building at the eastern extremity
of the fortress. The besieged
still defended themselves, hurling
down hand-grenades and masses of
stone, until at last, exhausted and
overcome, they hung out a white flag.
By their obstinate defence of an untenable
post, when they had no hope
of relief, they had forfeited their lives.
Fortunately their conqueror was no
Cabrera.</p>

<p>“They were Spaniards,” said
Espartero in his despatch to Madrid,
“blinded and deluded men who had
fought with the utmost valour, and I
could not do less than view them with
compassion.” Their lives were spared,
and the wounded were carried to the
hospital in the arms of their recent
opponents.</p>

<p>Cabrera had sworn to die before
giving up Morella, but when the time
came his heart failed him. He visited
the town, harangued the garrison and
inhabitants from the balcony of his
quarters, and told them that he had
come to share their fate. A day or
two later he marched away, taking
with him all his particular friends and
favourites, and left Morella to take
care of itself. It was the last place
attacked by Espartero. The siege
lasted eleven days, but Cabrera did
not come to its relief; dissension
arose amongst the garrison, and surrender
ensued. Three thousand prisoners,
including a number of Carlist
civil functionaries, a quantity of artillery,
ammunition, and other stores,
fell into the hands of the victors.
Morella taken, the war in Arragon
was at an end.</p>

<p>Determined that his last act should
be worthy of his whole career, Cabrera,
now upon his road to France,
precipitated into the Ebro a number
of national guards, whom he carried
with him as captives. Others were
shot, and some few were actually
dragged across the frontier, bound
hand and foot, and only liberated by
the French authorities. Such wanton
cruelty is the best refutation of the
arguments of certain writers, who
have maintained that Cabrera was
severe upon principle, with the sole
objects of intimidating the enemy, and
of furthering the cause of his king.
On the eve of his departure from
Spain, himself a fugitive, the self-styled
sovereign a captive in a foreign
land, what end, save the gratification
of his insatiable thirst of blood, could
be attained by the massacre of prisoners?
At last, on the sixth of
July 1840, he delivered his country
from the presence of the most execrable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
monster that has disgraced her
modern annals. On that day, at the
head of twenty battalions and two
hundred cavalry, Cabrera entered
France.</p>

<p>By superficial persons, unacquainted
with facts, attempts have been
made to cast upon the whole Spanish
nation the odium incurred by a small
section of it. The cruelties of Cabrera
and his likes, have been taken as an
index to the Spanish character, wherein
ferocity has been asserted to be the
most conspicuous quality. Nothing
can be more unjust and fallacious than
such a theory. Cabrera’s atrocities
were viewed and are remembered in
Spain with as deep a horror as in
England or France. Those who
shared in them were a minute fraction
of the population, and even of
these, many acted on compulsion,
and shuddered at the crimes they
were obliged to witness and abet.
Is the character of a nation to
be argued from the excesses of its
malefactors, even when, banded together
and in military array, they
assume the style and title of an army?
Assuredly not. The Carlist standard,
uplifted in Arragon, became a rallying
point for the scum of the whole
Spanish people. Under Cabrera’s
banner, murder was applauded, plunder
tolerated, vice of every description
freely practised. And accordingly,
escaped galley slaves, ruined
profligates, the worthless and abandoned,
flocked to its shelter. To
these may be added the destitute,
stimulated by their necessities; the
ignorant and fanatical, led away by
crafty priests; the unreflecting and
unscrupulous, seeking military distinction
where infamy alone was to
be reaped. Bad example, seduction,
even force, each contributed its quota
to the army of Cabrera. From the
commencement, the war was of a very
different nature in Navarre and in
Arragon. Both chiefs and soldiers
were of different origin, and fought
for different ends. To Navarre repaired
those men of worth and respectability
who conscientiously upheld
the rights of Don Carlos; the
battalions were composed of peasants
and artisans. In Arragon and Valencia,
a few desperate and dissolute
ruffians, such as Cabrera, Llangostera,
Quilez, Pellicer, assembled under
their orders the refuse of the jails.</p>

<p>“The Navarrese recruit,” says
Señor Cabello, “when he set out to
join the Carlists, took leave of his
friends and relatives, and even of the
alcalde of his village; the volunteer
into the faction of Arragon, departed
by stealth after murdering and robbing
some private enemy or wealthy neighbour.
The Biscayan Carlist, going
on leave to visit his mistress, took her
at most a flower gathered in the gardens
of Bilboa, when a soldier of
Cabrera revisited his home, he carried
with him the spoils of some slaughtered
family or plundered dwelling.
All Spain knew Colonel Zumalacarregui;
but only the lay brothers of St
Domingo de Tortosa, or the gendarmes
of Villafranca, could give an account
of Cabrera or the Serrador. To treat
with the former was to treat with one
who, a short time previously, had
commanded with distinction the first
light infantry regiment of the Spanish
army. To negotiate with the latter
was to condescend to an equality with
the Barbudo or José Maria.”<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Celebrated Spanish robbers.</p></div>

<p>Even in the inevitable confusion of
civil war, a distinction may and must
be made between the man who takes
up arms to defend a principle, and
him who makes the unhappy dissensions
of his country a stepping-stone
to his own ambition, a pretext for the
indulgence of the worst vices and
most unhallowed passions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span></h3>

<p>It was the last night of the boat
races. All Oxford, town and gown,
was on the move between Iffley and
Christchurch meadow. The reading
man had left his ethics only half understood,
the rowing man his bottle more
than half finished, to enjoy as beautiful
a summer evening as ever gladdened
the banks of Isis. One continued
heterogeneous living stream was pouring
on from St “<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Ole’s</i>” to King’s barge,
and thence across the river in punts,
down to the starting-place by the
lasher. One moment your tailor puffed
a cigar in your face, and the next, just
as you made some critical remark to
your companion on the pretty girl
you just passed, and turned round to
catch a second glimpse of her, you trod
on the toes of your college tutor. The
contest that evening was of more than
ordinary interest. The new Oriel boat,
a London-built clipper, an innovation
in those days, had bumped its other
competitor easily in the previous race,
and only Christchurch now stood between
her and the head of the river.
And would they, could they, bump
Christchurch to-night? That was the
question to which, for the time being,
the coming examination, and the coming
St Leger, both gave way. Christchurch,
that had not been bumped for
ten years before—whose old blue and
white flag stuck at the top of the mast
as if it had been nailed there—whose
motto on the river had so long been
“Nulli secundus?” It was an important
question, and the Christchurch
men evidently thought so. Steersman
and pullers had been summoned up
from the country, as soon as that
impertinent new boat had begun to
show symptoms of being a dangerous
antagonist, by the rapid progress she
was making from the bottom towards
the head of the racing-boats. The
old heroes of bygone contests were
enlisted again, like the Roman legionaries,
to fight the battles of their
“vexillum,” the little three-cornered
bit of blue and white silk before mentioned;
and the whole betting society
of Oxford were divided into two great
parties, the Oriel and the Christchurch,
the supporters of the old, or of the new
dynasty of eight oars.</p>

<p>Never was signal more impatiently
waited for than the pistol-shot which
was to set the boats in motion that
night. Hark! “Gentlemen, are—you—ready?”
“No, No!” shouts
some umpire, dissatisfied with the position
of his own boat at the moment.
“Gentlemen, are you ready?” Again
“No, no, no!” How provoking!
Christchurch and Oriel both beautifully
placed, and that provoking Exeter,
or Worcester, or some boat that
no one but its own crew takes the
slightest interest in to-night, right
across the river! And it will be getting
dusk soon. Once more—and
even Wyatt, the starter, is getting
impatient—“Are you ready?” Still
a cry of “No, no,” from some crew
who evidently never will be satisfied.
But there goes the pistol. They’re off,
by all that’s glorious! “Now Oriel!”
“Now Christchurch!” Hurrah! beautifully
are both boats pulled—how they
lash along the water! Oriel gains
evidently! But they have not got
into their speed yet, and the light
boat has the best of it at starting.
“Hurrah, Oriel, its all your own
way!” “Now, Christchurch, away
with her!” Scarcely is an eye turned
on the boats behind; and, indeed, the
two first are going fast away from
them. They reach the Gut, and at
the turn Oriel presses her rival hard.
The cheers are deafening; bets are
three to one. She must bump her!
“Now, Christchurch, go to work in
the straight water!” Never did a
crew pull so well, and never at such
disadvantage. Their boat is a tub
compared with the Oriel. See how
she buries her bow at every stroke.
Hurrah, Christchurch! The old boat
for ever! Those last three strokes
gained a yard on Oriel! She holds
her own still! Away they go, those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
old steady practised oars, with that
long slashing stroke, and the strength
and pluck begins to tell. Well pulled,
Oriel! Now for it! Not an oar out
of time, but as true together as a set
of teeth! But it won’t do! Still
Christchurch, by sheer dint of muscle,
keeps her distance, and the old flag
floats triumphant another year.</p>

<p>Nearly hustled to death in the rush
up with the racing boats, I panted
into the stern sheets of a four-oar
lying under the bank, in which I saw
Leicester and some others of my acquaintance.
“Well, Horace,” said I,
“what do you think of Christchurch
now?” (I had sufficient Tory principle
about me at all times to be a
zealous supporter of the “old cause,”
even in the matter of boat-racing.)
“How are your bets upon the London
clipper, eh?” “Lost, by Jove,” said
he; “but Oriel ought to have done
it to-night; why, they bumped all the
other boats easily, and Christchurch
was not so much better; but it was
the old oars coming up from the
country that did it. But what on
earth is all that rush about up by the
barges? They surely are not going to
fight it out after all?”</p>

<p>Something had evidently occurred
which was causing great confusion;
the cheering a moment before had
been deafening from the partisans of
Christchurch, as the victorious crew,
pale and exhausted with the prodigious
efforts they had made, mustered
their last strength to throw their oars
aloft in triumph, and then slowly, one
by one, ascended into the house-boat
which formed their floating dressing-room;
it had now suddenly ceased,
and confused shouts and murmurs,
rather of alarm than of triumph, were
heard instead: men were running to
and fro on both banks of the river,
but the crowd both in the boats on
the river and on shore made it impossible
for us to see what was going on.
We scrambled up the bank, and were
making for the scene of action, when
one of the river-officials ran hastily
by in the direction of Iffley.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Punt gone down, sir,” he replied
without stopping; “going for the
drags.”</p>

<p>“Anybody drowning?” we shouted
after him.</p>

<p>“Don’t know how many was in
her, sir,” sung out Jack in the distance.
We ran on. The confusion
was terrible; every one was anxious
to be of use, and more likely therefore
to increase the danger. The
punt which had sunk had been, as
usual on such occasions, overloaded
with men, some of whom had soon
made good their footing on the neighbouring
barges; others were still
clinging to their sides, or by their
endeavours to raise themselves into
some of the light wherries and four
oars, which, with more zeal than prudence,
were crowding to their assistance,
were evidently bringing a new
risk upon themselves and their rescuers.
Two of the last of the racing
eights, too, coming up to the winning-post
at the moment of the accident,
and endeavouring vainly to back water
in time, had run into each other, and
lay helplessly across the channel, adding
to the confusion, and preventing
the approach of more efficient aid to
the parties in the water. For some
minutes it seemed that the disaster
must infallibly extend itself. One
boat, whose crew had incautiously
crowded too much to one side in their
eagerness to aid one of the sufferers
in his struggles to get on board, had
already been upset, though fortunately
not in the deepest water, so
that the men, with a little assistance,
easily got on shore. Hundreds were
vociferating orders and advice, which
few could hear, and none attended to.
The most effectual aid that had been
rendered was the launching of two
large planks from the University
barge, with ropes attached to them,
which several of those who had been
immersed succeeded in reaching, and
so were towed safely ashore. Still,
however, several were seen struggling
in the water, two or three with evidently
relaxing efforts; and the unfortunate
punt; which had righted and
come up again, though full of water,
had two of her late passengers clinging
to her gunwale, and thus barely
keeping their heads above the water’s
edge. The watermen had done their
utmost to be of service, but the University
men crowded so rashly into
every punt that put off to the aid of
their companions, that their efforts
would have been comparatively abortive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
had not one of the pro-proctors
jumped into one, with two steady
hands, and authoritatively ordering
every man back who attempted to
accompany him, reached the middle
of the river, and having rescued those
who were in most imminent danger,
succeeded in clearing a sufficient space
round the spot to enable the drags to
be used, (for it was quite uncertain
whether there might not still be some
individuals missing.) Loud cheers
from each bank followed this very
sensible and seasonable exercise of
authority; another boat, by this
example, was enabled to disencumber
herself of superfluous hands, and by
their united exertions all who could
be seen in the water were soon picked
up and placed in safety. When the
excitement had in some degree subsided,
there followed a suspense which
was even more painful, as the drags
were slowly moved again and again
across the spot where the accident
had taken place. Happily our alarm
proved groundless. One body was
recovered, not an University man,
and in his case the means promptly
used to restore animation were successful.
But it was not until late in
the evening that the search was given
up, and even the next morning it was
a sensible relief to hear that no college
had found any of its members
missing.</p>

<p>I returned to my rooms as soon as
all reasonable apprehension of a fatal
result had subsided, though before the
men had left off dragging, and was
somewhat surprised, and at first
amused, to recognise, sitting before
the fire in the disguise of my own
dressing-gown and slippers, Charles
Russell.</p>

<p>“Hah! Russell, what brings you
here at this time of night?” said I;
“however, I’m very glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not sorry to find myself
here, I can tell you; I have been
in a less comfortable place to-night.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said I, as
a suspicion of the truth flashed upon
me—“Surely”——</p>

<p>“I have been in the water, that’s
all,” replied Russell quietly; “don’t
be alarmed, my good fellow, I’m all
right now. John has made me quite
at home here, you see. We found
your clothes a pretty good fit, got up
a capital fire at last, and I was only
waiting for you to have some brandy
and water. Now, don’t look so horrified,
pray.”</p>

<p>In spite of his good spirits, I thought
he looked pale; and I was somewhat
shocked at the danger he had been
in—more so from the suddenness of
the information.</p>

<p>“Why,” said I, as I began to recall
the circumstance, “Leicester and
I came up not two minutes after it
happened, and watched nearly every
man that was got out. You could
not have been in the water long then,
I hope?”</p>

<p>“Nay, as to that,” said Russell,
“it seemed long enough to me, I can
tell you, though I don’t recollect all
of it. I got underneath a punt or
something, which prevented my coming
up as soon as I ought.”</p>

<p>“How did you get out at last?”</p>

<p>“Why, that I don’t quite remember;
I found myself on the walk by
King’s barge; but they then had to turn
me upside down, I fancy, to empty
me. I’ll take that brandy by itself,
Hawthorne, for I think I have the
necessary quantity of water stowed
away already.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens! don’t joke about
it; why, what an escape you must
have had!”</p>

<p>“Well, seriously then, Hawthorne,
I <em>have</em> had a very narrow escape, for
which I am very thankful; but I
don’t want to alarm any one about
it, for fear it should reach my sister’s
ears, which I very much wish to
avoid, for the present at all events.
So I came up to your rooms here as
soon as I could walk. Luckily, John
saw me down at the water, so I came
up with him, and got rid of a good
many civil people who offered their
assistance; and I have sent down to
the lodgings to tell Mary I have staid
to supper with you; so I shall get
home quietly, and she will know nothing
about this business. Fortunately,
she is not in the way of hearing
much Oxford gossip, poor girl!”</p>

<p>Russell sat with me about an hour,
and then, as he said he felt very comfortable,
I walked home with him to
the door of his lodgings, where I
wished him good-night, and returned.</p>

<p>I had intended to have paid him an
early visit the next morning; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
somehow I was lazier than usual, and
had scarcely bolted my commons in
time to get to lecture. This over, I
was returning to my rooms, when
my scout met me.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” said he, “Mr Smith
has just been here, and wanted to see
you, he said, particular.”</p>

<p>Mr Smith? Of all the gentlemen
of that name in Oxford, I thought I
had not the honour of a personal
acquaintance with one.</p>

<p>“Mr Russell’s Mr Smith, sir,” explained
John: “the little gentleman
as used to come to his rooms so
often.”</p>

<p>I walked up the staircase, ruminating
within myself what possible business
“poor Smith” could have with
me, of whom he had usually appeared
to entertain a degree of dread. Something
to do with Russell, probably.
And I had half resolved to take the
opportunity to call upon him, and try
to make out who and what he was,
and how he and Russell came to be so
intimately acquainted. I had scarcely
stuck old Herodotus back into his
place on the shelf, however, when
there came a gentle tap at the door,
and the little Bible-clerk made his
appearance. All diffidence and shyness
had wholly vanished from his
manner. There was an earnest expression
in his countenance which
struck me even before he spoke. I
had scarcely time to utter the most
commonplace civility, when, without
attempt at explanation or apology, he
broke out with—“Oh, Mr Hawthorne,
have you seen Russell this morning?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, thinking he might
possibly have heard some false report
of the late accident—“but he was in
my rooms last night, and none the
worse for his wetting.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes! I know that; but
pray, come down and see him now—he
is very, very ill, I fear.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it? What on
earth is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he has been in a high fever
all last night! and they say he is
worse this morning—Dr Wilson and
Mr Lane are both with him—and
poor Miss Russell!—he does not
know her—not know his sister; and
oh, Mr Hawthorne, he must be <em>very</em>
ill; and they won’t let me go to him!”
And poor Smith threw himself into a
chair, and fairly burst into tears.</p>

<p>I was very much distressed too:
but, at the moment, I really believe I
felt more pity for the poor lad before
me, than even apprehension for my
friend Russell. I went up to him,
shook his hand, and begged him to
compose himself. Delirium, I assured
him—and tried hard to assure myself—was
the usual concomitant of fever,
and not at all alarming. Russell had
taken a chill, no doubt, from the unlucky
business of the last evening, but
there could not be much danger in so
short a time. “And now, Smith,”
said I, “just take a glass of wine,
and you and I will go down together,
and I dare say we shall find him better
by this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you,” he
replied; “you are very kind—very
kind indeed—no wine, thank you—I
could not drink it: but oh! if they
would only let me see him. And poor
Miss Russell! and no one to attend
to him but her!—but will you come
down now directly?”</p>

<p>My own anxiety was not less than
his, and in a very few minutes we
were at the door of Russell’s lodgings.
The answer to our inquiries
was, that he was in much the same
state, and that he was to be kept perfectly
quiet; the old housekeeper was
in tears; and although she said Dr
Wilson told them he hoped there
would be a change for the better soon,
it was evident that poor Russell was
at present in imminent danger.</p>

<p>I sent up my compliments to Miss
Russell to offer my services in any
way in which they could be made
available; but nothing short of the
most intimate acquaintance could have
justified any attempt to see her at
present, and we left the house. I
thought I should never have got
Smith from the door; he seemed thoroughly
overcome. I begged him to
come with me back to my rooms—a
Bible-clerk has seldom too many
friends in the University, and it
seemed cruel to leave him by himself
in such evident distress of mind. Attached
as I was to Russell myself, his
undisguised grief really touched me,
and almost made me reproach myself
with being comparatively unfeeling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
At any other time, I fear it might
have annoyed me to encounter as I
did the inquisitive looks of some of
my friends, as I entered the College
gates arm-in-arm with my newly-found
and somewhat strange-looking
acquaintance. As it was, the only
feeling that arose in my mind was a
degree of indignation that any man
should venture to throw a supercilious
glance at him; and if I longed to replace
his shabby and ill-cut coat by
something more gentlemanly in appearance,
it was for his sake, and not
my own.</p>

<p>And now it was that, for the first
time, I learnt the connexion that
existed between the Bible-clerk and
the quondam gentleman-commoner.
Smith’s father had been for many
years a confidential clerk in Mr Russell’s
bank; for Mr Russell’s bank it
was solely, the Smith who had been
one of the original partners having
died some two generations back,
though the name of the firm, as is not
unusual, had been continued without
alteration. The clerk was a poor relation,
in some distant degree, of the
some-time partner: his father, too,
had been a clerk before him. By
strict carefulness, he had saved some
little money during his many years of
hard work: and this, by special favour
on the part of Mr Russell, he
had been allowed to invest in the
bank capital, and thereby to receive
a higher rate of interest than he
could otherwise have obtained. The
elder Smith’s great ambition—indeed
it was his only ambition—for
the prosperity of the bank itself he
looked upon as a law of nature,
which did not admit of the feeling of
hope, as being a fixed and immutable
certainty—his ambition was to bring
up his son as a gentleman. Mr Russell
would have given him a stool and
a desk, and he might have aspired
hereafter to his father’s situation,
which would have assured him £250
per annum. But somehow the father
did not wish the son to tread in his
own steps. Perhaps the close confinement,
and unrefreshing relaxations of
a London clerk, had weighed heavily
upon his own youthful spirits: perhaps
he was anxious to spare the son
of his old age—for, like a prudent man,
he had not married until late in life—from
the unwholesome toils of the
counting-house, varied only too often
by the still less wholesome dissipation
of the evening. At all events, his
visions for him were not of annually
increasing salaries, and future independence:
of probable partnerships,
and possible lord mayoralties; but
of some cottage among green trees,
far away in the quiet country, where,
even as a country parson, people
would touch their hats to him as they
did to Mr Russell himself, and where,
when the time should come for superannuation
and a pension—the house
had always behaved liberally to its
old servants—his own last days might
happily be spent in listening to his
son’s sermons, and smoking his pipe—if
such a thing were lawful—in the
porch of the parsonage. So while the
principal was carefully training his
heir to enact the fashionable man at
Oxford, and in due time to take his
place among the squires of England,
and shunning, as if with a kind of remorseful
conscience, to make him a
sharer in his own contaminating speculations;
the humble official too, but
from far purer motives, was endeavouring
in his degree, perhaps unconsciously,
to deliver his boy from the
snares of Mammon. And when Charles
Russell was sent to the University,
many were the enquiries which Smith’s
anxious parent made, among knowing
friends, about the expenses and advantages
of an Oxford education.
And various, according to each individual’s
sanguine or saturnine temperament,
were the answers he obtained,
and tending rather to his bewilderment
than information. One intimate
acquaintance assured him, that the
necessary expenses of an under-graduate
<em>need</em> not exceed a hundred pounds
per annum: another—he was somewhat
of a sporting character—did not
believe any young man could do the
thing like a gentleman under five.
So Mr Smith would probably have
given up his darling project for his
son in despair, if he had not fortunately
thought of consulting Mr Russell
himself upon the point; and that
gentleman, though somewhat surprised
at his clerk’s aspiring notions,
good-naturedly solved the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
as to ways and means, by procuring
for his son a Bible-clerk’s appointment
at one of the Halls, upon which
he could support himself respectably,
with comparatively little pecuniary
help from his friends. With his
connexions and interest, it was no
great stretch of friendly exertion
in behalf of an old and trusted servant;
but to the Smiths, father and
son, both the munificence which designed
such a favour, and the influence
which could secure it, tended if
possible to strengthen their previous
conviction, that the power and the
bounty of the house of Russell came
within a few degrees of omnipotence.
Even now, when recent events had so
fearfully shaken them from this delusion;
when the father’s well-earned
savings had disappeared in the general
wreck with the hoards of wealthier
creditors, and the son was left almost
wholly dependent on the slender proceeds
of his humble office; even now,
as he told me the circumstances just
mentioned, regret at the ruined fortunes
of his benefactors seemed in a
great measure to overpower every
personal feeling. In the case of the
younger Russell, indeed, this gratitude
was not misplaced. No sooner
was he aware of the critical situation
of his father’s affairs, and the probability
of their involving all connected
with him, than, even in the midst of
his own harassing anxieties, he turned
his attention to the prospects of the
young Bible-clerk, whose means of
support, already sufficiently narrow,
were likely to be further straitened
in the event of a bankruptcy of the
firm. His natural good-nature had
led him to take some little notice of
young Smith on his first entrance at
the University, and he knew his
merits as a scholar to be very indifferent.
The obscure suburban boarding-school
at which he had been educated,
in spite of its high-sounding
name—“Minerva House,” I believe—was
no very sufficient preparation for
Oxford. When the Greek and the
washing are both extras, at three
guineas per annum, one clean shirt
in the week, and one lesson in <i>Delectus</i>,
are perhaps as much as can reasonably
be expected. Poor Smith
had, indeed, a fearful amount of uphill
work, to qualify himself even for
his “little-go.” Charles Russell, not
less to his surprise than to his unbounded
gratitude, inasmuch as he was
wholly ignorant of his motives for
taking so much trouble, undertook
to assist and direct him in his reading:
and Smith, when he had got over his
first diffidence, having a good share of
plain natural sense, and hereditary
habits of plodding, made more rapid
progress than might have been expected.
The frequent visits to Russell’s
rooms, whose charitable object
neither I nor any one else could have
guessed, had resulted in a very safe
pass through his first formidable ordeal,
and he seemed now to have little
fear of eventual success for his degree,
with a strong probability of being
privileged to starve upon a curacy
thereafter. But for Russell’s aid, he
would, in all likelihood, have been remanded
from his first examination
back to his father’s desk, to the bitter
mortification of the old man at the
time, and to become an additional
burden to him on the loss at once of
his situation and his little capital.</p>

<p>Poor Smith! it was no wonder that,
at the conclusion of his story, interrupted
constantly by broken expressions
of gratitude, he wrung his hands,
and called Charles Russell the only
friend he had in the world. “And,
oh! if he were to die! Do you think
he will die?”</p>

<p>I assured him I hoped and trusted
not, and with the view of relieving his
and my own suspense, though it was
little more than an hour since we had
left his door, we went down again to
make enquiries. The street door was
open, and so was that of the landlady’s
little parlour, so we walked in
at once. She shook her head in reply
to our inquiries. “Dr Wilson has
been up-stairs with him, sir, for the
last hour nearly, and he has sent twice
to the druggist’s for some things, and
I fancy he is no better at all events.”</p>

<p>“How is Miss Russell?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, she don’t take on much—not
at all, as I may say; but she
don’t speak to nobody, and she don’t
take nothing: twice I have carried her
up some tea, poor thing and she just
tasted it because I begged her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
she wouldn’t refuse me, I know—but,
poor dear young lady! it is very hard
upon her, and she all alone like.”</p>

<p>“Will you take up my compliments—Mr
Hawthorne—and ask if I
can be of any possible service?” said
I, scarce knowing what to say or do.
Poor girl! she was indeed to be pitied;
her father ruined, disgraced,
and a fugitive from the law; his only
son—the heir of such proud hopes and
expectations once—lying between life
and death; her only brother, her only
counsellor and protector, now unable
to recognise or to speak to her—and
she so unused to sorrow or hardship,
obliged to struggle on alone, and exert
herself to meet the thousand wants
and cares of illness, with the added
bitterness of poverty.</p>

<p>The answer to my message was
brought back by the old housekeeper,
Mrs Saunders. She shook her head,
said her young mistress was very
much obliged, and would be glad if I
would call and see her brother tomorrow,
when she hoped he would
be better; “But oh, sir!” she added,
“He will never be better any more!
I know the doctors don’t think so,
but I can’t tell her, poor thing—I try
to keep her up, sir; but I do wish
some of her own friends were here—she
won’t write to any body, and I
don’t know the directions”—and she
stopped, for her tears were almost
convulsing her.</p>

<p>I could not remain to witness misery
which I could do nothing to relieve;
so I took Smith by the arm—for
he stood by the door half-stupified,
and proceeded back towards college.
He had to mark the roll at his own
chapel that evening; so we parted at
the top of the street, after I had made
him promise to come to breakfast
with me in the morning. Russell’s
illness cast a universal gloom over the
college that evening; and when the
answer to our last message, sent down
as late as we could venture to do,
was still unfavourable, it was with
anxious anticipation that we awaited
any change which the morrow might
bring.</p>

<p>The next day passed, and still Russell
remained in the same state. He
as in a high fever, and either perfectly
unconscious of all around him,
or talking in that incoherent and yet
earnest strain, which is more painful
to those who have to listen to and
to soothe than even the total prostration
of the reason. No one was
allowed to see him; and his professional
attendants, though they held
out hopes founded on his youth and
good constitution, acknowledged that
every present symptom was most unfavourable.</p>

<p>The earliest intelligence on the third
morning was, that the patient had
passed a very bad night, and was
much the same; but in the course of
an hour or two afterwards, a message
came to me to say that Mr Russell
would be glad to see me. I rushed,
rather than ran, down to his lodgings,
in a perfect exultation of hope, and
was so breathless with haste and excitement
when I arrived there, that I
was obliged to pause a few moments
to calm myself before I raised the
carefully muffled knocker. My joy
was damped at once by poor Mrs
Saunders’ mournful countenance.</p>

<p>“Your master is better, I hope—is
he not?” said I.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not, sir; but he is
very quiet now: and he knew his poor
dear sister; and then he asked if any
one had been to see him, and we mentioned
you, sir; and then he said he
should like to see you very much, and
so Miss made bold to send to you—if
you please to wait, sir, I’ll tell her
you are here.”</p>

<p>In a few moments she returned—Miss
Russell would see me if I would
walk up.</p>

<p>I followed her into the little drawing-room,
and there, very calm and
very pale, sat Mary Russell. Though
her brother and myself had now so
long been constant companions, I had
seen but very little of her; on the very
few evenings I had spent with Russell
at his lodgings she had merely
appeared to make tea for us, had
joined but little in the conversation,
and retired almost before the table
was cleared. In her position, this
behaviour seemed but natural; and
as, in spite of the attraction of her
beauty, there was a shade of that
haughtiness and distance of manner
which we had all at first fancied in
her brother, I had begun to feel a respectful
kind of admiration for Mary
Russell, tinged, I may now venture
to admit—I was barely twenty at the
time—with a slight degree of awe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
Her very misfortunes threw over her
a sort of sanctity. She was too beautiful
not to rivet the gaze, too noble
and too womanly in her devotion to
her brother not to touch the affections,
but too cold and silent—almost as it
seemed too sad—to love. Her brother
seldom spoke of her; but when he did
it was in a tone which showed—what
he did not care to conceal—his deep
affection and anxious care for her;
he watched her every look and movement
whenever she was present; and
if his love erred in any point, it was,
that it seemed possible it might be
even too sensitive and jealous for her
own happiness.</p>

<p>The blinds were drawn close down,
and the little room was very dark;
yet I could see at a glance the work
which anguish had wrought upon her
in the last two days, and, though no
tears were to be seen now, they had
left their traces only too plainly. She
did not rise, or trust herself to speak;
but she held out her hand to me as if
we had been friends from childhood.
And if thorough sympathy, and mutual
confidence, and true, but pure affection,
make such friendship, then surely
we became so from that moment. I
never thought Mary Russell cold
again—yet I did not dream of loving
her—she was my sister in every thing
but the name.</p>

<p>I broke the silence of our painful
meeting—painful as it was, yet not
without that inward throb of pleasure
which always attends the awakening
of hidden sympathies. What I said
I forget; what does one, or can one
say, at such moments, but words utterly
meaningless, so far as they affect
to be an expression of what we feel?
The hearts understand each other
without language, and with that we
must be content.</p>

<p>“He knew me a little while ago,”
said Mary Russell at last; “and
asked for you; and I knew you would
be kind enough to come directly if I
sent.”</p>

<p>“Surely it must be a favourable
symptom, this return of consciousness?”</p>

<p>“We will hope so: yes, I thought
it was and oh! how glad I was! But
Dr Wilson does not say much, and I
fear he thinks him weaker. I will go
now and tell him you are come.”</p>

<p>“You can see him now if you
please,” she said when she returned;
“he seems perfectly sensible still
and, when I said you were here, he
looked quite delighted.” She turned
away, and, for the first time, her
emotion mastered her.</p>

<p>I followed her into her brother’s
room. He did not look so ill as I
expected; but I saw with great
anxiety, as I drew nearer his bed,
that his face was still flushed with
fever, and his eye looked wild and
excited. He was evidently, however,
at present free from delirium, and
recognised me at once. His sister
begged him not to speak much, or ask
questions, reminding him of the physician’s
strict injunctions with regard
to quiet.</p>

<p>“Dr Wilson forgets, my love, that
it is as necessary at least for the mind
to be quiet as the tongue,” said Russell
with an attempt to smile; and
then, after a pause, he added, as he
took my hand, “I wanted to see you,
Hawthorne; I know I am in very
great danger; and, once more, I want
to trouble you with a confidence.
Nay, nothing very important; and
pray, don’t ask me, as I see you are
going to do, not to tire myself with
talking: I know what I am going to
say, and will try to say it very shortly;
but thinking is at least as bad for
me as speaking.” He paused again
from weakness; Miss Russell had left
the room. I made no reply. He
half rose, and pointed to a writing-desk
on a small table, with keys in
the lock. I moved towards it, and
opened it, as I understood his gestures;
and brought to him, at his
request, a small bundle of letters,
from which he selected one, and gave
it me to read. It was a banker’s
letter, dated some months back, acknowledging
the receipt of three hundred
pounds to Russell’s credit, and
enclosing the following <span class="locked">note:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,—Messrs —— are directed to
inform you of the sum of £300 placed
to your credit. You will be wrongly
advised if you scruple to use it. If
at any time you are enabled, and desire
it, it may be repaid through the
same channel.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">One of your Father’s Creditors.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
“I have never touched it,” said
Russell, as I folded up the note.</p>

<p>“I should have feared you would
not,” said I.</p>

<p>“But now,” he proceeded, “now
things seem changed with me. I
shall want money—Mary will; and I
shall draw upon this unseen charity;
ay, and gratefully. Poor Mary!”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, my dear Russell,”
said I, eager to interrupt a train
of thought which I saw would be too
much for him. “I will manage all
that for you, and you shall give me
the necessary authority till you get
well again yourself,” I added in a tone
meant to be cheerful.</p>

<p>He took no notice of my remark.
“I fear,” said he, “I have not been
wise counsellor to my poor sister.
She had kind offers from more than
one of our friends, and might have
had a home more suited to her than
this has been, and I allowed her to
choose to sacrifice all her own prospects
to mine!”</p>

<p>He turned his face away, and I
knew that one painful thought besides
was in his mind—that they had been
solely dependent on her little income
for his support at the University since
his father’s failure.</p>

<p>“Russell,” said I gently, “this
conversation can surely do no good;
why distress yourself and me unnecessarily?
Come, I shall leave you
now, or your sister will scold me.
Pray, for all our sakes, try to sleep;
you know how desirable it is, and
how much stress Dr Wilson has laid
upon your being kept perfectly calm
and quiet.”</p>

<p>“I will, Hawthorne, I will try;
but oh, I have so much to think of!”</p>

<p>Distressed and anxious, I could only
take my leave of him for the present,
feeling how much there was, indeed, in
his circumstances to make rest even
more necessary, and more difficult to
obtain, for the mind than for the body.</p>

<p>I had returned to the sitting-room,
and was endeavouring to give as hopeful
answers as I could to Miss Russell’s
anxious inquiries as to what I thought
of her brother, when a card was
brought up, with a message that Mr
Ormiston was below, and “would be
very glad if he could see Miss Russell
for a few moments, at any hour she
would mention, in the course of the
day.”</p>

<p>Ormiston! I started, I really did
not know why. Miss Russell started
also, visibly; did she know why? Her
back was turned to me at the moment;
she had moved, perhaps intentionally,
the moment the message became intelligible,
so that I had no opportunity of
watching the effect it produced, which I
confess I had an irrepressible anxiety to
do. She was silent, until I felt my position
becoming awkward: I was rising
to take leave, which perhaps would
have made hers even more so, when,
half turning round towards me, with
a tone and gesture almost of command,
she said, “Stay!” and then,
in reply to the servant, who was still
waiting, “Ask Mr Ormiston to walk
up.”</p>

<p>I felt the few moments of expectation
which ensued to be insufferably
embarrassing. I tried to persuade
myself it was my own folly to think
them so. Why should Ormiston <em>not</em>
call at the Russells, under such circumstances?
As college tutor, he
stood almost in the relation of a natural
guardian to Russell; Had he
not at least as much right to assume
the privilege of a friend of the family
as I had, with the additional argument,
that he was likely to be much
more useful in that capacity? He
had known them longer, at all events,
and any little coolness between the
brother and himself was not a matter,
I felt persuaded, to be remembered
by him at such moment, or to induce
any false punctilio which might stand
in the way of his offering his sympathy
and assistance, when required. But
the impression on my mind was strong—stronger,
perhaps, than any facts
within my knowledge fairly warranted—that
between Ormiston and
Mary Russell there either was, or had
been, some feeling which, whether
acknowledged or unacknowledged—whether
reciprocal or on one side
only—whether crushed by any of those
thousand crosses to which such feelings,
fragile as they are precious, are
liable, or only repressed by circumstances
and awaiting its developement—would
make their meeting under
such circumstances not that of
ordinary acquaintances. And once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
again I rose, and would have gone;
but again Mary Russell’s sweet voice—and
this time it was an accent of
almost piteous entreaty, so melted and
subdued were its tones, as if her spirit
was failing her—begged me to remain—“I
have something—something
to consult you about—my
brother.”</p>

<p>She stopped, for Ormiston’s step
was at the door. I had naturally—not
from any ungenerous curiosity to
scan her feelings—raised my eyes to
her countenance while she spoke to
me, and could not but mark that her
emotion amounted almost to agony.
Ormiston entered; whatever his feelings
were, he concealed them well;
not so readily, however, could he suppress
his evident astonishment, and
almost as evident vexation, when he
first noticed my presence: an actor
in the drama for whose appearance he
was manifestly unprepared. He approached
Miss Russell, who never
moved, with some words of ordinary
salutation, but uttered in a low and
earnest tone, and offered his hand,
which she took at once, without any
audible reply. Then turning to me,
he asked if Russell were any better?
I answered somewhat indefinitely,
and Miss Russell, to whom he turned
as for a reply, shook her head, and,
sinking into a chair, hid her face in
her hands. Ormiston took a seat
close by her, and after a pause of a
moment said,</p>

<p>“I trust your very natural anxiety
for your brother makes you inclined
to anticipate more danger than really
exists, Miss Russell: but I have to
explain my own intrusion upon you
at such a moment”—and he gave me a
glance which was meant to be searching—“I
called by the particular request
of the Principal, Dr Meredith.”</p>

<p>Miss Russell could venture upon no
answer, and he went on, speaking
somewhat hurriedly and with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Mrs Meredith has been from
home some days, and the Principal
himself has the gout severely; he
feared you might think it unkind their
not having called, and he begged me
to be his deputy. Indeed he insisted
on my seeing you in person, to express
his very sincere concern for
your brother’s illness, and to beg that
you will so far honour him—consider
him sufficiently your friend, he said—as
to send to his house for any thing
which Russell could either want or
fancy, which, in lodgings, there might
be some difficulty in finding at hand.
In one respect, Miss Russell,” continued
Ormiston in somewhat a more
cheerful tone, “your brother is fortunate
in not being laid up within the
college walls; we are not very good
nurses there, as Hawthorne can tell
you, though we do what we can; yet
I much fear this watching and anxiety
have been too much for you.”</p>

<p>Her tears began to flow freely;
there was nothing in Ormiston’s
words, but their tone implied deep
feeling. Yet who, however indifferent,
could look upon her helpless
situation, and not be moved? I
walked to the window, feeling terribly
out of place where I was, yet uncertain
whether to go or stay; for my
own personal comfort, I would sooner
have faced the collected anger of a
whole common-room, called to investigate
my particular misdemeanours;
but to take leave at this moment
seemed as awkward as to stay; besides,
had not Miss Russell appeared
almost imploringly anxious for me to
spare her a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>?</p>

<p>“My poor brother is very, very
ill, Mr Ormiston,” she said at last,
raising her face, from which every
trace of colour had again disappeared,
and which seemed now as calm as
ever. “Will you thank Dr Meredith
for me, and say I will without
hesitation avail myself of his most
kind offers, if any thing should occur
to make his assistance necessary.”</p>

<p>“I can be of no use myself in any
way?” said Ormiston with some
hesitation.</p>

<p>“I thank you, no,” she replied;
and then, as if conscious that her tone
was cold, she added—“You are very
kind: Mr Hawthorne was good enough
to say the same. Every one is very
kind to us, indeed; but”—and here
she stopped again, her emotion threatening
to master her; and Ormiston
and myself simultaneously took our
leave.</p>

<p>Preoccupied as my mind had been
by anxiety on Russell’s account, it
did not prevent a feeling of awkwardness
when I found myself alone with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Mr Ormiston outside the door of his
lodgings. It was impossible to devise
any excuse at the moment for turning
off in a different direction, as I felt
very much inclined to do; for the little
street in which he lived was not much
of a thoroughfare. The natural route
for both of us to take was that which
led towards the High Street, for a
few hundred steps the other way
would have brought us out into the
country, where it is not usual for
either tutors or under-graduates to
promenade in cap and gown, as they
do, to the great admiration of the
rustics, in our sister university.
We walked on together, therefore,
feeling—I will answer at least for one
of us—that it would be an especial
relief just then to meet the greatest
bore with whom we had any pretence
of a speaking acquaintance, or pass
any shop in which we could frame the
most threadbare excuse of having
business, to cut short the embarrassment
of each other’s company. After
quitting any scene in which deep
feelings have been displayed, and in
which our own have been not slightly
interested, it is painful to feel called
upon to make any comment on what
has passed; we feel ashamed to do so
in the strain and tone which would
betray our own emotion, and we have
not the heart to do so carelessly or
indifferently. I should have felt this,
even had I been sure that Ormiston’s
feelings towards Mary Russell had
been nothing more than my own;
whereas, in fact, I was almost sure of
the contrary; in which case it was
possible that, in his eyes, my own
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">locus standi</i> in that quarter, surprised
as I had been in an apparently very
confidential interview, might seem to
require some explanation which would
be indelicate to ask for directly, and
which it might not mend matters if I
were to give indirectly without being
asked. So we proceeded some paces
up the little quiet street, gravely and
silently, neither of us speaking a word.
At last Ormiston asked me if I had
seen Russell, and how I thought him?
adding, without waiting for a reply,
“Dr Wilson, I fear from what he told
me, thinks but badly of him.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear you say
so,” I replied; and then ventured to
remark how very wretched it would
be for his sister, in the event of his
growing worse, to be left at such a
time so utterly helpless and alone.</p>

<p>He was silent for some moments.
“Some of her friends,” he said at last,
“ought to come down; she must have
friends, I know, who would come if
they were sent for. I wish Mrs
Meredith were returned—she might
advise her.”</p>

<p>He spoke rather in soliloquy than
as addressing me, and I did not feel
called upon to make any answer.
The next moment we arrived at the
turn of the street, and, by what seemed
a mutual impulse, wished each other
good-morning.</p>

<p>I went straight down to Smith’s
rooms, at —— Hall, to get him to
come and dine with me; for I pitied
the poor fellow’s forlorn condition,
and considered myself in some degree
bound to supply Russell’s place towards
him. A Bible-clerk’s position
in the University is always more or less
one of mortification and constraint. It
is true that the same academical degree,
the same honours—if he can obtain
them—the same position in after life—all
the solid advantages of a University
education, are open to him, as to other
men; but, so long as his undergraduateship
lasts, he stands in a very different
position from other men, and
he feels it—feels it, too, through three
or four of those years of life when such
feelings are most acute, and when
that strength of mind which is the
only antidote—which can measure
men by themselves and not by their
accidents—is not as yet matured either
in himself or in the society of which
he becomes a member. If, indeed, he
be a decidedly clever man, and has
the opportunity early in his career of
showing himself to be such, then there
is good sense and good feeling enough—let
us say, to the honour of the
University, there is sufficient of that
true <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">esprit du corps</i>, a real consciousness
of the great objects for which
men are thus brought together—to ensure
the acknowledgment from all
but the most unworthy of its members,
that a scholar is always a gentleman.
But if he be a man of only moderate
abilities, and known only as a Bible-clerk,
then, the more he is of a gentleman
by birth and education, the
more painful does his position generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
become. There are not above
two or three in residence in most colleges,
and their society is confined
almost wholly to themselves. Some
old schoolfellow, indeed, or some man
who “knows him at home,” holding
an independent rank in college, may
occasionally venture upon the condescension
of asking him to wine—even
to meet a friend or two with whom he
can take such a liberty; and even
then, the gnawing consciousness that
he is considered an inferior—though
not treated as such—makes it a questionable
act of kindness. Among the
two or three of his own table, one is
the son of a college butler, another
has been for years usher at a preparatory
school; he treats them with civility,
they treat him with deference;
but they have no tastes or feelings in
common. At an age, therefore, which
most of all seeks and requires companionship,
he has no companions; and
the period of life which should be the
most joyous, becomes to him almost a
purgatory. Of course, the radical and
the leveller will say at once, “Ay,
this comes of your aristocratic distinctions;
they ought not to be allowed
in universities at all.” Not
so: it comes of human nature; the
distinction between a dependent and
an independent position will always
be felt in all societies, mark it
outwardly as little as you will. Humiliation,
more or less, is a penalty
which poverty must always pay.
These humbler offices in the University
were founded by a charity as wise
as benevolent, which has afforded to
hundreds of men of talent, but of
humble means, an education equal to
that of the highest noble in the land,
and, in consequence, a position and
usefulness in after life, which otherwise
they could never have hoped for.
And if the somewhat servile tenure
by which they are held, (which in late
years has in most colleges been very
much relaxed,) were wholly done
away with, there is reason to fear
the charity of the founders would be
liable to continual abuse, by their being
bestowed upon many who required
no such assistance. As it is, this occurs
too often; and it is much to be
desired that the same regulations
were followed in their distribution,
throughout the University, which some
colleges have long most properly
adopted: namely, that the appointment
should be bestowed on the successful
candidate after examination,
strict regard being had to the circumstances
of all the parties before they
are allowed to offer themselves. It
would make their position far more
definite and respectable, because all
would then be considered honourable
to a certain degree, as being the reward
of merit; instead of which, too
often, they are convenient items of
patronage in the hands of the Principal
and Fellows, the nomination to
them depending on private interest,
which by no means ensuring the nominee’s
being a gentleman by birth,
while it is wholly careless of his being
a scholar by education, and tends
to lower the general standing of the
order in the University.</p>

<p>This struck me forcibly in Smith’s
case. Poor fellow! with an excellent
heart and a great deal of sound common
sense, he had neither the breeding
nor the talent to make a gentleman
of. I doubt if an University
education was any real boon to him.
It ensured him four years of hard
work—harder, perhaps, than if he had
sat at a desk all the time—without the
society of any of his own class and
habits, and with the prospect of very
little remuneration ultimately. I think
he might have been very happy in his
own sphere, and I do not see how he
could be happy at Oxford. And
whether he or the world in general
ever profited much by the B.A. which
he eventually attached to his name,
is a point at least doubtful.</p>

<p>I could not get him to come and
dine with me in my own college. He
knew his own position, as it seemed,
and was not ashamed of it; in fact,
in his case, it could not involve any
consciousness of degradation; and I
am sure his only reason for refusing
my invitations of that kind was, that
he thought it possible my dignity
might be compromised by so open an
association with him. He would come
over to my rooms in the evening to
tea, he said; and he came accordingly.
When I told him in the morning that
Russell had inquired very kindly after
him, he was much affected; but it had
evidently been a comfort to him to
feel that he was not forgotten, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
during the hour or two which we
spent together in the evening, he
seemed much more cheerful.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they will let me see him
to-morrow, if he is better?” he said,
with an appealing look to me. I assured
him I would mention his wish
to Russell, and his countenance at
once brightened up, as if he thought
only his presence were needed to ensure
our friend’s recovery.</p>

<p>But the next morning all our hopes
were dashed again; delirium had returned
as had been feared, and the
feverish symptoms seemed to gain
strength rather than abate. Bleeding,
and the usual remedies had been
had recourse to already to a perilous
extent, and in Russell’s present reduced
state, no further treatment of
the kind could be ventured upon.
“All we can do now, sir,” said Dr
Wilson, “is little more than to let
nature take her course. I <em>have known</em>
such cases recover.” I did not ask to
see Mary Russell that day; for what
could I have answered to her fears
and inquiries? But I thought of Ormiston’s
words; surely she ought to
have some friend—some one of her
own family, or some known and tried
companion of her own sex, would
surely come to her at a moment’s
notice, did they but know of her trying
situation. If—if her brother were
to die—she surely would not be left
here among strangers, quite alone?
Yet I much feared, from what had
escaped him at our last interview,
that they had both incurred the charge
of wilfulness for refusing offers of assistance
at the time of their father’s
disgrace and flight, and that having,
contrary to the advice of their friends,
and perhaps imprudently, taken the
step they had done in coming to Oxford,
Mary Russell, with something
of her brother’s spirit, had made up
her mind now, however heavy and
unforeseen the blow that was to fall,
to suffer all in solitude and silence.
For Ormiston, too, I felt with an interest
and intensity that was hourly
increasing. I met him after morning
chapel, and though he appeared intentionally
to avoid any conversation
with me, I knew by his countenance
that he had heard the unfavourable
news of the morning; and it could
be no common emotion that had left
its visible trace upon features usually
so calm and impassible.</p>

<p>From thoughts of this nature, indulged
in the not very appropriate
locality of the centre of the quadrangle,
I was roused by the good-humoured
voice of Mrs Meredith—“our
governess,” as we used to call her—who,
with the doctor himself, was just
then entering the College, and found
me right in the line of her movements
towards the door of “the lodgings.”
I was not until that moment aware of
her return, and altogether was considerably
startled as she addressed
me with—“Oh! how do you do, Mr
Hawthorne? you young gentlemen
don’t take care of yourselves, you see,
when I am away—I am so sorry to
hear this about poor Mr Russell! Is
he so very ill? Dr Meredith is just
going to see him.”</p>

<p>I coloured up, I dare say, for it was
a trick I was given to in those days,
and, in the confusion, replied rather to
my own thoughts than to Mrs Meredith’s
question.</p>

<p>“Mrs Meredith! I really beg your
pardon,” I first stammered out as a
very necessary apology, for I had
nearly stumbled over her—“May I
say how very glad I am you are returned,
on Miss Russell’s account—I
am sure <span class="locked">”——</span></p>

<p>“Really, Mr Hawthorne, it is very
natural I suppose, but you gentlemen
seem to expend your whole sympathy
upon the young lady, and forget the
brother altogether! Mr Ormiston
actually took the trouble to write to
me about <span class="locked">her”——</span></p>

<p>“My dear!” interposed the Principal.</p>

<p>“Nay, Dr Meredith, see how guilty
Mr Hawthorne looks! and as to Mr
Ormiston”—“Well, never mind,”
(the doctor was visibly checking his
lady’s volubility,) “I love the poor dear
girl so much myself, that I am really
grieved to the heart for her. I shall
go down and see her directly, and
make her keep up her spirits. Dr
Wilson is apt to make out all the bad
symptoms he can—I shall try if I can’t
cure Mr Russell myself, after all; a
little proper nursing in those cases is
worth a whole staff of doctors—and, as
to this poor girl, what can she know
about it? I dare say she sits crying
her eyes out, poor thing, and doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
nothing—<em>I’ll</em> see about it. Why, I
wouldn’t lose Mr Russell from the
college for half the young men in it—would
I, Dr Meredith?”</p>

<p>I bowed, and they passed on. Mrs
Principal, if somewhat pompous occasionally,
was a kind-hearted woman;
I believe an hour scarcely elapsed
after her return to Oxford, before she
was in Russell’s lodgings, ordering
every thing about as coolly as if it
were in her own house, and all but
insisting on seeing the patient and
prescribing herself for him in spite
of all professional injunctions to the
contrary. The delirium passed off
again, and though it left Russell sensibly
weaker, so weak, that when I
next was admitted to see him with
Smith, he could do little more than
feebly grasp our hands, yet the fever
was evidently abated; and in the
course of the next day, whether it
was to be attributed to the remedies
originally used, or to his own youth
and good constitution, or to Mrs
Meredith’s experienced directions in
the way of nursing, and the cheerful
spirit which that good lady, in spite
of a little fussness, succeeded generally
in producing around her, there
was a decided promise of amendment,
which happily each succeeding
hour tended gradually to fulfil. Ormiston
had been unremitting in his
inquiries; but I believe had never
since sought an interview either with
the brother or sister. I took advantage
of the first conversation Russell
was able to hold with me, to mention
how very sincerely I believed him to
have felt the interest he expressed.
A moment afterwards, I felt almost
sorry I had mentioned the name—it
was the first time I had done so during
Russell’s illness. He almost started
up in bed, and his face glowed
again with more than the flush of
fever, as he caught up my words.</p>

<p>“Sincere, did you say? Ormiston
sincere! You don’t know the man
as I do. Inquired here, did he?
What right has he to intrude <span class="locked">his”——</span></p>

<p>“Hush, my dear Russell,” I interposed,
really almost alarmed at his
violence. “Pray, don’t excite yourself—I
think you do him great injustice;
but we will drop the subject, if
you please.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, Hawthorne, if you
knew all, you would despise him as
much as I do.”</p>

<p>It is foolish to argue with an invalid—but
really even my friendship for
Russell would not allow me to bear
in silence an attack so unjustifiable,
as it seemed to me, on the character
of a man who had every claim to my
gratitude and respect. I replied
therefore, somewhat incautiously, that
perhaps I did know a little more than
Russell suspected.</p>

<p>He stared at me with a look of
bewilderment. “What do you know?”
he asked quickly.</p>

<p>It was too late to hesitate or retract.
I had started an unfortunate
subject; but I knew Russell too well
to endeavour now to mislead him.
“I have no right perhaps to say I
know any thing; but I have gathered
from Ormiston’s manner, that he has
very strong reasons for the anxiety
he has shown on your account. I
will not say more.”</p>

<p>“And how do you know this? Has
Mr Ormiston dared <span class="locked">”——</span></p>

<p>“No, no, Russell,” said I, earnestly;
“see how unjust you are, in this
instance.” I wished to say something
to calm him, and it would have been
worse than useless to say any thing
but the truth. I saw he guessed to
what I alluded; and I gave him
briefly my reasons for what I thought,
not concealing the interview with his
sister, at which I had unintentionally
been present.</p>

<p>It was a very painful scene. When
he first understood that Ormiston had
sought the meeting, his temper, usually
calm, but perhaps now tried by
such long hours of pain and heaviness,
broke out with bitter expressions
against both. I told him, shortly
and warmly, that such remarks
towards his sister were unmanly and
unkind; and then he cried, like a
chidden and penitent child, till his
remorse was as painful to look upon
as his passion. “Mary! my own
Mary! even you, Hawthorne, know
and feel her value better than I do!
I for whom she has borne so much.”</p>

<p>“I am much mistaken,” said I,
“if Ormiston has not learned to
appreciate her even yet more truly.
And why not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
“Leave me now,” he said; “I
am not strong enough to talk; but if
you wish to know what cause I have
to speak as I have done of your friend
Ormiston, you shall hear again.”</p>

<p>So exhausted did he seem by the
excess of feeling which I had so unfortunately
called forth, that I would
not see him again for some days,
contenting myself with learning that
no relapse had taken place, and that
he was still progressing rapidly towards
recovery.</p>

<p>I had an invitation to visit my
aunt again during the Easter vacation,
which had already commenced,
and had only been prevented from
leaving Oxford by Russell’s alarming
state. As soon, therefore, as all danger
was pronounced over, I prepared
to go up to town at once, and my
next visit to Russell was in fact to
wish him good-by for two or three
weeks. He was already sitting up,
and fast regaining strength. He
complained of having seen so little of
me lately, and asked me if I had seen
his sister. “I had not noticed it
until the last few days,” he said—“illness
makes one selfish, I suppose;
but I think Mary looks thin and ill—very
different from what she did a
month back.”</p>

<p>But watching and anxiety, as I
told him, were not unlikely to produce
that effect; and I advised him
strongly to take her somewhere for a
few weeks for change of air and
scene. “It will do you both good,”
I said; “and you can draw another
L.50 from your unknown friend for
that purpose; it cannot be better
applied, and I should not hesitate for
a moment.”</p>

<p>“I would not,” he replied, “if I
wanted money; but I do not. Do
you know that Dr Wilson would take
no fee whatever from Mary during
the whole of his attendance; and
when I asked him to name some sufficient
remuneration, assuring him I
could afford it, he said he would never
forgive me if I ever mentioned the
subject again. So what remains of
the fifty you drew for me, will amply
suffice for a little trip somewhere for
us. And I quite agree with you in
thinking it desirable, on every account,
that Mary should move from
Oxford—perhaps altogether—for one
reason, to be out of the way of a
friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“Ormiston?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Ormiston; he called here
again since I saw you, and wished to
see me; but I declined the honour.
Possibly,” he added bitterly, “as
we have succeeded in keeping out of
jail here, he thinks Mary has grown
rich again.” And then he went on
to tell me, how, in the days of his
father’s reputed wealth, Ormiston had
been a constant visitor at their house
in town, and how his attentions to
his sister had even attracted his
father’s attention, and led to his name
being mentioned as likely to make an
excellent match with the rich banker’s
daughter. “My father did not like
it,” he said, “for he had higher views
for her, as was perhaps excusable—though
I doubt if he would have
refused Mary any thing. I did not
like it for another reason: because I
knew all the time how matters really
stood, and that any man who looked
for wealth with my sister would in
the end be miserably disappointed.
What Mary’s own feelings were, and
what actually passed between her and
Ormiston, I never asked; but she
knew my views on the subject, and
would, I am certain, never have accepted
any man under the circumstances
in which she was placed, and
which she could not explain. I did
hope and believe, however, then, that
there was sufficient high principle
about Ormiston to save Mary from
any risk of throwing away her heart
upon a man who would desert her
upon a change of fortune. I think he
loved her at the time—as well as such
men as he can love any one; but
from the moment the crash came—Ormiston,
you know, was in town at
the time—there was an end of every
thing. It was an opportunity for a
man to show feeling if he had any;
and though I do not affect much
romance, I almost think that, in such
a case, even an ordinary heart might
have been warmed into devotion;
but Ormiston—cold, cautious, calculating
as he is—I could almost have
laughed at the sudden change that
came over him when he heard
the news. He pretended, indeed,
great interest for us, and certainly did
seem cut up about it; but he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
committed himself, I conclude, and
took care to retreat in time. Thank
Heaven! even if Mary did ever care for
him, she is not the girl to break her
heart for a man who proves so unworthy
of her regard. But why he
should insist on inflicting his visits upon
us now, is what I cannot make
out, and what I will not endure.”</p>

<p>I listened with grief and surprise.
I knew well, that not even the strong
prejudice which I believed Russell to
have always felt against Ormiston,
would tempt him to be guilty of misrepresentation:
and, again, I gave him
credit for too much penetration to have
been easily deceived. Yet I could not
bring myself all at once to think so ill
of Ormiston. He had always been
considered in pecuniary matters liberal
almost to a fault, that he really loved
Mary Russell, I felt more than ever
persuaded; and, at my age, it was
hard to believe that a few thousand
pounds could affect any man’s decision
in such a point, even for a moment.
Why, the very fact of her being poor
and friendless was enough to make
one fall in love with such a girl
at once! So when Russell, after watching
the effect of his disclosure, misconstruing
my silence, proceeded to
ask somewhat triumphantly—“<em>Now</em>,
what say you of Mr Ormiston?”—I
answered at once, that I was strongly
convinced there was a mistake.</p>

<p>“Ay,” rejoined he with a sneering
laugh; “on Ormiston’s part, you
mean; decidedly there was.”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said I, “there has been
some misunderstanding, which time
may yet explain: I do not, and will
not believe him capable of what you
impute to him. Did you ever ask
your sister for a full and unreserved
explanation of what has passed between
them?”</p>

<p>“Never; but I know that she has
shunned all intercourse with him as
carefully as I have, and that his recently
renewed civilities have given
her nothing but pain.” My own observation
certainly tended to confirm
this: So, changing the subject—for it
was one on which I had scarce any
right to give an opinion, still less offer
advice, asked whether I could
do any thing for him in town; and,
after exchanging a cordial good-by
with Miss Russell, in whose appearance
I was sorry to see confirmation
of her brother’s fears for her health, I
took my leave, and the next morning
saw me on the top of “The Age,” on
my way to town.</p>

<p>There I received a letter from my
father, in which he desired me to take
the opportunity of calling upon his
attorney, Mr Rushton, in order to have
some leases and other papers read and
explained to me, chiefly matters of
form, but which would require my
signature upon my coming of age. It
concluded with the following <span class="locked">P.S.:—</span></p>

<p>“I was sorry to hear of your
friend’s illness, and trust he will now
do very well. Bring him down with
you at Christmas, if you can. I hear,
by the way, there is a <em>Miss</em> Russell
in the case—a very fascinating young
lady, whom you never mention at all—a
fact which your mother, who is
up to all those things, says is very
suspicious. All I can say is, if she is
as good a girl as her mother was before
her—I knew her well once—you
may bring her down with you too, if
you like.”</p>

<p>How very unlucky it is that the
home authorities seldom approve of
any little affairs of the kind except
those of which one is perfectly innocent!
Now, if I <em>had</em> been in love with
Mary Russell, the governor would, in
the nature of things, have felt it his
duty to be disagreeable.</p>

<p>I put off the little business my father
alluded to day after day, to make
way for more pleasant engagements,
until my stay in town was drawing to
a close. Letters from Russell informed
me of his having left Oxford
for Southampton, where he was reading
hard, and getting quite stout; but
he spoke of his sister’s health in a tone
that alarmed me, though he evidently
was trying to persuade himself that
a few weeks’ sea-air would quite restore
it. At last I devoted a morning
to call on Mr Rushton, whom I
found at home, though professing, as
all lawyers do, to be full of business.
He made my acquaintance as politely
as if I had been the heir-expectant of
an earldom, instead of the very moderate
amount of acres which had escaped
sale and subdivision in the Hawthorne
family. In fact, he seemed a
very good sort of fellow, and we ran
over the parchments together very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
amicably—I almost suspected he was
cheating me, he seemed so very friendly,
but therein I did him wrong.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear sir,” continued
he, as we shut up the last of them,
“will you dine with me to-day? Let
me see; I fear I can’t say before
seven, for I have a great deal of work
to get through. Some bankruptcy
business, about which I have taken
some trouble,” he continued, rubbing
his hands, “and which we shall manage
pretty well in the end, I fancy.
By the way, it concerns some friends
of yours, too: is not Mr Ormiston of
your college? Ay, I thought he was;
he is two thousand pounds richer than
he fancied himself yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Really?” said I, somewhat interested;
“how, may I ask?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, when Russell’s
bank broke—bad business that—we all
thought the first dividend—tenpence-halfpenny
in the pound, I believe it
was—would be the final one: however,
there are some foreign securities
which, when they first came into the
hands of the assignees, were considered
of no value at all, but have
gone up wonderfully in the market
just of late, so that we have delayed
finally closing accounts till we could
sell them to such advantage as will
leave some tolerable pickings for the
creditors after all.”</p>

<p>“Had Ormiston money in Mr Russell’s
bank, then, at the time?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes: something like eight
thousand pounds: not all his own,
though: five thousand he had in trust
for some nieces of his, which he had
unluckily just sold out of the funds,
and placed with Russell, while he was
engaged in making arrangements for
a more profitable investment; the
rest was his own.”</p>

<p>“He lost it all, then?”</p>

<p>“All but somewhere about three
hundred pounds, as it appeared at
the time. What an excellent fellow
he is! You know him well, I dare
say. They tell me that he pays the
interest regularly to his nieces for
their money out of his own income
still.”</p>

<p>I made no answer to Mr Rushton
at the moment, for a communication
so wholly unexpected had awakened
a new set of ideas, which I was
busily following out in my mind. I
seemed to hold in my hands the clue
to a good deal of misunderstanding
and unhappiness. My determination
was soon taken to go to Southampton,
see Russell at once, and tell him what
I had just heard, and of which I had
no doubt he had hitherto been as
ignorant as myself. I was the rather
induced to take this course, as I felt
persuaded that Miss Russell’s health
was suffering rather from mental than
bodily causes; and, in such a case, a
great deal of mischief is done in a
short time. I would leave town at
once.</p>

<p>My purse was in the usual state of
an under-graduate’s at the close of a
visit to London; so, following up the
train of my own reflections, I turned
suddenly upon Mr Rushton, who was
again absorbed in his papers, and had
possibly forgotten my presence altogether,
and attacked him <span class="locked">with—</span></p>

<p>“My dear sir, can you lend me
ten pounds?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Mr Rushton,
taking, off his spectacles, and feeling
in his pockets, at the same time looking
at me with some little curiosity,—
“certainly—with great pleasure.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon for taking such
a liberty,” said I, apologetically;
“but I find I must leave town to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night!” said the lawyer,
looking still more inquiringly at me;
“I thought you were to dine with
me?”</p>

<p>“I cannot exactly explain to you
at this moment, sir, my reasons; but
I have reasons, and I think sufficient
ones, though they have suddenly occurred
to me.”</p>

<p>I pocketed the money, leaving Mr Rushton
to speculate on the eccentricities
of Oxonians as he pleased, and
a couple of hours found me on the
Southampton mail.</p>

<p>The Russells were surprised at my
sudden descent upon them, but welcomed
me cordially; and even Mary’s
pale face did not prevent my being in
excellent spirits. As soon as I could
speak to Russell by himself, I told
him what I had heard from Mr Rushton.</p>

<p>He never interrupted me, but his
emotion was evident. When he did
speak, it was in an altered and humbled
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
“I never inquired,” he said, “who
my father’s creditors were—perhaps
I ought to have done so; but I
thought the knowledge could only
pain me. I see it all now; how unjust,
how ungrateful I have been!
Poor Mary!”</p>

<p>We sat down, and talked over
those points in Ormiston’s conduct
upon which Russell had put so unfavourable
a construction. It was
quite evident, that a man who could
act with so much liberality and self-denial
towards others, could have had
no interested motives in his conduct
with regard to Mary Russell; and
her brother was now as eager to express
his confidence in Ormiston’s
honour and integrity, as he was before
hasty in misjudging him.</p>

<p>Where all parties are eager for explanation,
matters are soon explained.
Russell had an interview with
his sister, which brought her to the
breakfast table the next morning with
blushing cheeks and brightened eyes.
<em>Her</em> misgivings, if she had any, were
easily set at rest. He then wrote to
Ormiston a letter full of generous
apologies and expressions of his high
admiration of his conduct, which was
answered by that gentleman in person
by return of post. How Mary
Russell and he met, or what they
said, must ever be a secret, for no
one was present but themselves. But
all embarrassment was soon over,
and we were a very happy party for
the short time we remained at Southampton
together; for, feeling that
my share in the matter was at an
end—a share which I contemplated
with some little self-complacency—I
speedily took my departure.</p>

<p>If I have not made Ormiston’s conduct
appear in as clear colours to the
reader as it did to ourselves, I can
only add, that the late misunderstanding
seemed a painful subject to all
parties, and that the mutual explanations
were rather understood than
expressed. The anonymous payment
to Russell’s credit at the Bank was
no longer a mystery: it was the poor
remains of the College Tutor’s little
fortune, chiefly the savings of his
years of office—the bulk of which had
been lost through the fault of the father—generously
devoted to meet the necessities
of the son. That he would
have offered Mary Russell his heart and
hand at once when she was poor, as
he hesitated to do when she was rich,
none of us for a moment doubted, had
not his own embarrassments, caused
by the failure of the bank, and the
consequent claims of his orphan
nieces, to replace whose little income
he had contracted all his own expenses,
made him hesitate to involve
the woman he loved in an imprudent
marriage.</p>

<p>They were married, however, very
soon—and still imprudently, the world
said, and my good aunt among the
rest; for, instead of waiting an indefinite
time for a good college living to
fall in, Ormiston took the first that
offered, a small vicarage of £300 a-year,
intending to add to his income
by taking pupils. However, fortune
sometimes loves to have a laugh at
the prudent ones, and put to the rout
all their wise prognostications; for,
during Ormiston’s “year of grace”—while
he still virtually held his fellowship,
though he had accepted the
living—our worthy old Principal died
somewhat suddenly, and regret at his
loss only gave way to the universal
joy of every individual in the college,
(except, I suppose, any disappointed
aspirants,) when Mr Ormiston was
elected almost unanimously to the
vacant dignity.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Mr Russell the elder has never returned
to England. On the mind of
such a man, after the first blow, and
the loss of his position in the world,
the disgrace attached to his name had
comparatively little effect. He lives
in some small town in France, having
contrived, with his known <em>clever
management</em>, to keep himself in comfortable
circumstances, and his best
friends can only strive to forget his
existence, rather than wish for his
return. His son and daughter pay
him occasional visits, for their affection
survives his disgrace, and forgets
his errors. Charles Russell took a
first class, after delaying his examination
a couple of terms, owing to
his illness, and is now a barrister,
with a reputation for talent, but as yet
very little business. However I
hear the city authorities had
the impudence to seize some of the
college plate in discharge of a disputed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
claim for rates, and that Russell
is retained as one of the counsel
in an action of replevin, I trust he
will begin a prosperous career, by
contributing to win the cause for the
“gown.”</p>

<p>I spent a month with Dr and Mrs
Ormiston at their vicarage in the
country, before the former entered
upon his official residence as Principal;
and can assure the reader that,
in spite of ten—it may be more—years
of difference in age, they are
the happiest couple I ever saw. I
may almost say, the only happy
couple I ever saw, most of my married
acquaintance appearing at the
best only <em>contented</em> couples, not drawing
their happiness so exclusively
from each other as suits my notion of
what such a tie ought to be. Of course,
I do not take my own matrimonial
experience into account; the same
principle of justice which forbids a
man to give evidence in his own favour,
humanely excusing him from
making any admission which may
criminate himself. Mrs Ormiston is
as beautiful, as amiable, as ever, and
has lost all the reserve and sadness
which, in her maiden days, over-shadowed
her charms; and so sincere
was and is my admiration of her person
and character, and so warmly
was I in the habit of expressing it,
that I really believe my dilating upon
her attractions used to make Mrs
Francis Hawthorne somewhat jealous,
until she had the happiness to
make her acquaintance, and settled
the point by falling in love with the
lady herself.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="HEXAMETERS">LETTERS ON ENGLISH HEXAMETERS.</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Letter II.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr Editor</span>—I should like to offer you some more of my criticisms
on the hexameters which have been written in English, and, by your good
leave, will try to do so at some future time. But there are probably some
of your readers who entertain the prejudices against English hexameters
which we often hear from English critics of the last generation. I cannot
come to any understanding with these readers about special hexameters, till I
have said something of these objections to hexameters in general. One of
these objections I tried to dispose of in a former missive; namely, that “we
cannot have good hexameters in English, because we have so few spondees.”
There are still other erroneous doctrines commonly entertained relative to
this matter, which may be thus briefly expressed;—that in hexameters we
adopt a difference of long and short syllables, such as does not regulate other
forms of English versification; and that the versification itself—the movement
of the hexameter—is borrowed from Greek and Latin poetry. Now, in
opposition to these opinions, I am prepared to show that our English hexameters
suppose no other relations of strong and weak syllables than those
which govern our other kinds of verse;—and that the hexameter movement
is quite familiar to the native English ear.</p>

<p>The first of these truths, I should have supposed to be, by this time,
generally acknowledged among all writers and readers of English verse:
if it had not been that I have lately seen, in some of our hexametrists, a
reference to a difference of <em>long</em>, and <em>short</em>, as something which we ought to
have, in addition to the differences of strong and weak syllables, in order to
make our hexameters perfect. One of these writers has taken the model
<span class="locked">hexameter—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“In the hexameter rises the fountain’s silvery column;”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and has objected to it that the first syllable of <em>column</em> is <em>short</em>. But, my dear
sir, it is not shorter than the first syllable of <em>collar</em>, or of the Latin <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">collum</i>!
The fact is, that in hexameters, as in all other English verses, the ear knows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
nothing of <em>long</em> and <em>short</em> as the foundation of verse. All verse, to an English
ear, is governed by the succession of <em>strong</em> and <em>weak</em> syllables. Take a
stanza of <span class="locked">Moore’s:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<em>When</em> in <em>death</em> I shall <em>calm</em> re<em>cline</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O <em>bear</em> my <em>heart</em> to my <em>mis</em>tress <em>dear</em>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Tell</em> her it <em>lived</em> upon <em>smiles</em> and <em>wine</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of the <em>bright</em>est <em>hue</em> while it <em>ling</em>er’d <em>here</em>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I have marked the strong syllables, which stand in the place of long ones,
so far as the actual <em>existence</em> of verse is concerned; though no doubt the
<em>smoothness</em> of the verse is promoted by having the light syllables short also,
that they may glide rapidly away. But this, I say, though favourable to
smoothness, is not essential to verse: thus the syllable <em>death</em>, though strong,
is short; <em>I</em> and <em>while</em>, though weak, are long.</p>

<p>Now this alternation, in a certain order, of strong and weak syllables, is
the essential condition of all English verse, and of hexameters among the
rest. Long and short syllables, to English ears, are superseded in their effect
by strong and weak accents; and even when we read Greek and Latin verses,
so far as we make the versification perceptible, we do so by putting strong
accents on the long syllables. The English ear has no sense of any versification
which is not thus constructed.</p>

<p>I had imagined that all this was long settled in the minds of all readers of
poetry; and that all notion of syllables in English being long, for purposes of
versification, because they contain a long vowel or a diphthong, or a vowel
before two consonants, had been obliterated ages ago. I knew, indeed, that
the first English hexametrists had tried to conform themselves to the Latin
rules of quantity. Thus, as we learn from Spenser, they tried to make the
second syllable of <em>carpenter</em> long; and constructed their verses so that they
would <em>scan</em> according to Latin rules. Such are Surry’s hexameters; for <span class="locked">instance:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Unto a caitiff wretch whom long affliction holdeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant yet, grant yet a look to the last monument of his anguish.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But this made their task extremely difficult, without bringing any gain which
the ear could recognise; and I believe that the earlier attempts to naturalize
the hexameter in England failed mainly in consequence of their being executed
under these severe conditions, which prevented all facility and flow in
the expression, and gave the popular ear no pleasure.</p>

<p>The successful German hexametrists have rejected all regard to the classical
rules of quantity of syllables; and have, I conceive, shown us plainly
that this is the condition of success in such an undertaking. Take, for instance,
the beginning of <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hermann und Dorothea</cite>:—</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" xml:lang="de" lang="de">
<span class="iq">“Und so sass das trauliche Paar, sich unter den Thorweg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ueber das wander de Volk mit mancher Bemerkung ergötgend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endlich aber began der wüedige Hansfrau, und sagte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sept! dort kommt der Prediger her; es kommt auch der Nachbar.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The penultimate dactyls in these lines, “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">unter dem</i> Thorweg,” “Be<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">merkung
er</i>götgend,” “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Hansfrau und</i> sagte,” “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">kommt auch der</i> Nachbar,” have, in the
place of short syllables, syllables which must be long, if any distinction of
long and short, depending upon consonants and dipthongs, be recognised;
but yet these are good and orderly dactyls, because in each we have a strong
syllable followed by two weak ones. If we call such trissyllable feet <em>dactyls</em>,
and in the same way describe other feet by their corresponding names in
Greek and Latin verse, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">spondees</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">trochees</i>, and the like, we shall be able to
talk in an intelligible manner about English verse in general, and English
hexameters in particular.</p>

<p>And I have now to show, in the second place, that English hexameters are
readily accepted by the native ear, without any condition of discipline in
Greek and Latin verse. I do not mean to say that hexameters have not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
peculiar character among our forms of verse; and I should like to try to
explain, on some future occasion, the mode in which the recollection of
Homer and Virgil, in Greek and Latin, affects and modifies the pleasure
which we receive from hexameter poems in German and English. But I say
that, without any such reference, poems written in rigorous hexameters will
be recognised by a common reader as easy current verse.</p>

<p>In order to bring out this point clearly, you must allow me, Mr Editor, to
make my quotations with <em>various readings</em> of my own, which are requisite to
exemplify the forms of verse of which I speak.</p>

<p>I begin by talking of “dactylics,” in spite of the <em>Antijacobin</em>. Dactylic
measures are very familiar to our ears, and congenial to the genius of our
versification. These lines are <span class="locked">dactylics:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Oh | know ye the | land where the | cypress and | myrtle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are | emblems of | deeds that are | done in their | clime?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">But the lines may be also regarded as <span class="locked">anapæstics:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Oh know | ye the land | &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are em | blems of deeds | &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the rage | of the vul | ture, the love | of the turtle,|<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now melt | into sor | row, now mad | den to crime.|”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In all these cases, the line begins with a weak syllable; and if the lines are
regarded as dactylics, this syllable must be taken as a fragment of foot.
When the line begins with a strong syllable, the dactylic character is more
decided: as if the lines <span class="locked">were,—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Know ye the land of the cypress and myrtle?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Now, in such examples, along with the trissyllable feet, dissyllable feet are
often mixed, as their metrical equivalents: as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<em>When in</em> | death I shall | <em>calm re</em> | cline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O | <em>bear my</em> | heart to my | <em>mistress</em> | dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her it | lived upon | <em>smiles and</em> | wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the | <em>brightest</em> | hue, while it | <em>lingered</em> | here.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We may observe that there is, in this example, a kind of symmetry shown
in preserving the dissyllable feet always in the second place, which is not
without its effect on the ear. Some of these feet may be made two or three
syllables at pleasure, as <em>linger’d</em> or <em>lingerèd</em>. I will add the next stanza as a
further <span class="locked">example:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Bid her not | <em>shed one</em> | <em>tear of</em> | sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To | sully a | <em>heart so</em> | brilliant and | bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But | <em>drops of</em> | <em>kind re</em> | <em>membrance</em> | borrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To | <em>bathe the</em> | relic from | <em>morn to</em> | night.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>That the verse so constructed is perfectly rhythmical, we know, by the
exactness with which it lends itself to music. The musical bars would point
out the divisions, or the number at least, of the feet, if we had any doubt upon
that subject.</p>

<p>In order that we may the more distinctly perceive the mixture of two
kinds of feet in this example, let us reduce it entirely to trissyllable feet, by
slight changes in the <span class="locked">expression:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in my tomb I shall calmly be | lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O | carry my heart to my conqueror dear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her it liv’d upon smiles and on | nectar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of | brilliant hue, while it lingered here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid her not shed any token of | sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To | sully a heart so resplendant and | glowing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But | fountains of loving remem<em>ber</em>ance | borrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To | water the relic from morning to even.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
I have arranged this variation so that the incomplete feet at the end of one
line and the beginning of the next in each distich, as well as the rest, make
up a complete dactyl; and thus, the measure runs on through each two
written lines in a long line of seven dactyls and a strong syllable. But it
will be easily perceived, that if the feet had been left incomplete at the end of
each written line, the pause in the metre would have supplied what was
wanting, and would have prevented the verse from being perceived as irregular.
Thus these are still true dactylic <span class="locked">lines:——</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in my tomb I shall calmly recline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O carry my heart to my conqueror dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her it lived upon smiles and on wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brilliant hue, while it lingered here.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I will now arrange the same passage so as to reduce it entirely to dissyllable
feet, which alters the character of the versification.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in death I calm recline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O bear my heart to her I love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say it liv’d on smiles and wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brightest hue, while here above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid her shed no tear of grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To soil a heart so clear and bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But drops of kind remembrance give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe the gem from morn to night.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As the dissyllable feet may be divided either as dactyls or as anapæsts, so
the dissyllable feet may be divided either as trochees or as iambuses. Thus
we may scan either of these <span class="locked">ways—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O | bear my | heart to | her I | love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O bear | my heart | to her | I love.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But in this case, as in that of dissyllable feet, the metre is more decidedly
trochaic, because each line, (that is, each distich, as here written,) begins with
a strong syllable.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>When</em> in | death I | calm re | cline.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The animated trochaic character, when once given by a few lines of this
kind, continues in the movement of the verse, even when retarded by initial
iambuses; as,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jest and youthful jollity:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quips and cranks and wanton wiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nods and becks and wreathed smiles;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as dwell on Hebe’s <em>cheek</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And</em> love to live in dimple sleek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sport that wrinkled care de<em>rides</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And</em> laughter holding both his sides.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Here the weak syllables <em>And</em>, <em>And</em>, do not materially interrupt the trochaic
verse. They may be taken as completing the trochee at the end of the preceding
line.</p>

<p>In these verses, and in all English verses, there are no spondees, or feet
consisting of two strong syllables. No foot in English metre has more than
one strong syllable, and the weak syllables are appended to the strong ones, and
swept along with them in the current of the metre. The equality between
a trissyllable and a consecutive dissyllable foot, which the metre requires, is
preserved by adding strength to the short syllable, so as to preserve the
balance. Thus, when we <span class="locked">say——</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Bear</em> my heart to my <em>mis</em>tress dear,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">There is a strength given to <em>bear</em>, and <em>mis</em>tress, which makes them metrically
balance <em>carry</em> and <em>conqueror</em> in this verse,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Carry</em> my heart to my <em>conqueror</em> dear.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
It must be observed, however, that the proportion between heavy and light,
or strong and weak, in syllables, is not always the same. When a dissyllable
foot occurs in the place of a trissyllable one, in a metre of a generally trissyllabic
character, the light syllable may be conceived as standing in the place of
two, and is therefore more weighty than the light syllables of the trissyllabic
feet. Thus, if we <span class="locked">say—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tell her it lived upon smiles <em>and</em> wine,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">the <em>and</em> is more weighty than it would be, if we were to <span class="locked">say—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tell her it lived upon smiles <em>and on</em> wine.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And if again we <span class="locked">say—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Tell her it liv’d <em>on</em> smiles and on wine,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">the <em>on</em> is more weighty than the same syllable in <em>upon</em>. Hence, in these cases,
<em>smiles and</em>, <em>lived on</em>, approach to spondees. But still there is a decided preponderance
in the first syllables of each of these feet respectively.</p>

<p>I have hitherto considered dactylics with rhyme; of course the measure
may be preserved, though the rhyme be omitted, either at the end of the
alternate lines; as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When in my tomb I am calmly lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O bear my heart to my mistress dear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her it liv’d upon smiles and nectar<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of brightest hue, while it lingered here:<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Or altogether; as</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bid her not shed one tear of sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sully a heart so brilliant and bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But drops from fond remembrance gather,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bathe for ever the relic in these.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the absence of rhyme, each distich is detached, and the number of such
distiches, or long lines, may be either odd or even.</p>

<p>I shall now take a shorter dactylic measure; and first, with alternate
rhymes.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Tityrus, you laid along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shade of umbrageous beeches,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Practise your pastoral song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As your muse in your solitude teaches.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We from the land that we love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all that we value and treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We must as exiles remove:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, Tityrus, you at your leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make all the woods to resound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amaryllis’s name at your pleasure.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We see, in this example that the rhyme is a fetter to the construction. In
this case, it is necessary to have three distichs which rhyme, in order to close
the metre with the sentence.</p>

<p>We detach these distichs, or long lines, from each other, by rejecting the
use of rhyme between successive distichs. We might make the two parts of
the same long line rhyme <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the shadow Of chestnuts stretcht in the meadow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Practise your pastoral verses In strains which your oat-pipe rehearses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, poor exiles, are leaving All our saving and having;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the land that we treasure: You in the woods at your pleasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make them resound, when your will is, The name of the fair Amaryllis.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But these rhymes, even if written in one long line, are really two short
lines with a double rhyme; and this measure, besides its difficulty, is destitute
of dignity and grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
If we take the same measure, rejecting rhyme, and keep the dactylics pure,
we have such distichs as <span class="locked">these:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of a mulberry idly reclining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Practise your pastoral muse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the strains that your flageolet utters.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But these may be written in long lines, <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the shade of a mulberry idly reclining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Practise your pastoral muse, in the strains that your flageolet utters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We from the land that we love, from our property sever’d and banish’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We go as exiles away; and yet, Tityrus, you at your leisure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tutor the forests to ring with the name of the fair Amaryllis.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>These verses are of a rhythm as familiar and distinct to the English ear as
any which our poets use. Now these are <em>hexameters</em> consisting each of five
dactyls and a trochee,—the trochee approaching to a spondee, as I have
seen; yet still, not being a spondee, but having its first syllable decidedly
strong in comparison with the second.</p>

<p>The above hexameters are perfectly regular, both in being purely dactylic,
and in having the regular <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cæsura</i>, namely the end of a word at the beginning
of the third dactyl, <span class="locked">as—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We from the land that we <em>love</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We go as exiles <em>away</em>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But these hexameters admit of irregularities in the same manner as the
common English measures of which we have spoken. We may have dissyllable
feet instead of trissyllable in any place in the line; thus in the <span class="locked">fourth—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the shade of a <em>chestnut</em> idly reclining.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the <span class="locked">third—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the <em>shade of</em> mulberries idly reclining.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the <span class="locked">second—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, <em>you in</em> shadows of mulberries idly reclining.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In the <span class="locked">first—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>Damon</em>, you in the shade of a mulberry idly reclining.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We may also have a dissyllable for the fifth <span class="locked">foot—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tityrus, you in the shade of a beech at your <em>ease re</em>clining.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But this irregularity disturbs the dactylic character of the verse more than
the like substitution in any other place. So long as we have a dactyl in the
fifth place, the dactylic character remains. Thus, even if we make all the
rest <span class="locked">dissyllables—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Damon, you in shades of beech-trees idly reclining.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>But if the fifth foot also be a dissyllable, the measure becomes trochaic.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Damon, you in shades of beech at ease reclining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Play your oaten pipe, your rural strains combining.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Supposing the dactylic character to be retained, we may have dissyllables
not in one place only, but in several, as we have seen is the case in the more
common English dactylics. Now, the metre thus produced corresponds with
the heroic verse hexameters of the Greek and Latin languages; except in this,
that the English dissyllable feet are not exactly spondees. The Greek and Latin
hexameters admit of dactyls and spondees indiscriminately, except that the
fifth foot is regularly a dactyl, and the sixth a spondee or trochee. Also, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
regular cæsura of the Greek and Latin hexameters occurs in the beginning
of the third foot, as in the English hexameters above given.</p>

<p>I think I have now shown that, without at all deviating from the common
forms of English metre, and their customary liberties, we arrive at a metre
which represents the classical hexameters, with this difference only, that the
spondees are replaced by trochees. And this substitution is a necessary
change; it results from the alternation of strong and weak syllables, which
is a condition of all English versification.</p>

<p>And thus I have, I conceive, established my second point; that hexameters,
exactly representing those of Greek and Latin verse, may grow out of purely
English habits of versification.</p>

<p>But at the same time, I allow that classical scholars do read and write
English hexameters with a recollection of those which they are familiar with
in Greek and Latin; and that they have a disposition to identify the rhythm
of the ancient and the modern examples, which leads them to treat English
hexameters differently from other forms of English verse. This gives rise to
some particularities of English hexameters, of which I may have a few words
to say hereafter. In the mean time, I subscribe myself, your obedient</p>

<h2 id="ALGERIA">ALGERIA</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p0">[<cite>Algeria and Tunis in 1845.</cite> By <span class="smcap">Captain J. C. Kennedy</span>, 18th Royal Irish.
London: 1846.]</p>

<p class="center b2">[<cite>Algeria in 1845.</cite> By <span class="smcap">Count St Marie</span>, formerly in the French Military Service.
London: 1846.]</p>

<p>We have always felt a strong interest
in the welfare and progress of the
French colonies in Africa. Our reasons
for the same are manifold, and
must be manifest to the readers of
Maga; that is to say, to all judicious
and reflecting persons conversant with
the English language. There is, indeed,
much to excite sympathy and
admiration in the conduct of our
neighbours to their infant settlement
in the land of the Moor and the Arab.
Their treatment of the natives has
been uniformly considerate, their
anxiety to avoid bloodshed painfully
intense, their military operations have
been invariably successful, and in their
countless triumphs, modestly recorded
in the veracious bulletins of a Bugeaud,
they have ever shown themselves
generous and magnanimous
conquerors. The result of their humane
and judicious colonial administration,
and of a little occasional
wholesome severity on the part of
Colonel Pelissier, or some other intrepid
officer, is most satisfactory and
evident. A hundred thousand men
are now sufficient to keep the ill-armed
and scattered Arab tribes in a
state of perfect tranquillity. Twice
or thrice in the year, it is true, they
rise up, like ill-bred savages as they
are, and fiercely assault the Europeans
who have kindly volunteered, to govern
their country, and, whenever it may
be possible, to civilize themselves. A
few unfortunate French detachments,
outposts and colonists, are plundered
and slaughtered; but then up comes
a Lamoricière or a Changarnier, perchance
the Duke of Isly himself, or a
prince of the blood in person, with
thousands of bayonets and sabres; and
forthwith the turbulent Bedouins
scamper across the desert in tumultuous
flight, their dingy bournouses
waving in the wind, shouts of fury and
exultation upon their lips, and Frenchmen’s
heads upon the points of their
scimeters. As to Abd-el-Kader, the
grand instigator of these unjustifiable
outbreaks, he is a troublesome and
discontented barbarian, always kicking
up a devil of a hubbub, usually
appearing where least desired, but,
when wanted, never to be found. The
gallant and <em>reverend</em> gentleman—for,
besides being an emir and a general,
he is a marabout or saint of the very
first chop—has caused the aforesaid
Bugeaud a deal of annoyance; and the
marshal has long been desirous of a
personal interview, which hitherto has
been obstinately declined. Altogether
the emir is a vexatious fellow; and it
is another strong proof of French kindness
and conciliatory spirit, that although
he has frequently wandered
about in very reduced circumstances,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans</i> army or friends, with a horse and
a half, and a brace of barefooted followers,
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vide</i> the Paris newspapers of
any date for the last dozen years,) the
French, instead of laying hold of him
and hanging him up, which of course
they might easily have done, have
preferred to leave him at large. Some
say that it would be as unreasonable
to expect an enthusiastic fox-hunter
to waylay and shoot the animal that
affords him sport, as to look for the
capture of Abd-el-Kader at the hands
of men who find pleasure and profit in
the chase, but would derive little of
either from its termination. To cut
his throat would be to cut their own,
and to slay the bird that lays the
golden epaulets. It is related, in a
book now before us, that M. Bugeaud,
when applied to by a colonel for a column
of troops to pursue and capture
the emir, replied in these terms:—“Do
not forget, sir, that to Abd-el-Kader
most of your brother officers
are indebted for their chances of promotion.”
Others have asserted, that
if the Arab chief is still a free denizen
of the desert, it must be attributed to
his own skill, courage, and conduct;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
to the bravery of his troops, and the
fidelity of his adherents; and not to
any merciful or prudential scruples of
his opponents. We reject this notion
as absurd and groundless. We are
persuaded that French forbearance is
the sole reason that the head of Abd-el-Kader,
duly embalmed by the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">procédé</i>
Gannal, does not at this moment
grace the sideboard of the victorious
Duke of Isly, or frown grimly from
the apex of the Luxor obelisk.</p>

<p>Having thus avowed our strong interest
in the prosperity of Algeria, we
need hardly say that we read every
book calculated to throw light upon
the progress and prospects of that
country. The volumes referred to at
foot of the first page, had scarcely issued
from the sanctuaries of their respective
publishers, when our paper-knife
was busy with their contents,
and as we cut we eagerly read. We
confess to have been disappointed.
Captain Kennedy’s narrative is tame,
and rather pedantic; its author appears
more anxious to display his
classical and historical lore, and to indulge
in long descriptions of scenery
and Arab encampments, than to give us
the sort of information we should most
have appreciated and relished. As a
book of travels, it is respectable, and
not unamusing; but from travellers
in a country whose state is exceptional,
one has a right to expect more.
We had hoped for more copious details
of the present condition and probable
result of French colonization,
for more numerous indications of the
state of feeling and intercourse between
the Arab tribes and their European
conquerors. These matters
are but slightly touched upon. It
is true that Captain Kennedy, in his
preface, avows his intention of not
entering into political discussions, and
of abstaining from theories as to the
future condition of the southern coast
of the Mediterranean. We can only
regret, therefore, that he has <em>not</em>
thought proper to be more comprehensive.
His opportunities were excellent,
his pen is fluent, and he evidently
possesses some powers of
observation. Received with open
arms and cordial hospitality by the
numerous officers to whom he had introductions,
or with whom he casually
became acquainted, he has perhaps
felt a natural unwillingness to
probe and lay bare the weak points of
the French in Africa. Such, at least,
is the general impression conveyed to
us by his book. He seems hampered
by fear of requiting kindness by censure;
and, to escape the peril, has
abstained from criticism, forgetting
the possible construction that may be
put upon his silence. There is certainly
scope for a work on Algeria of
a less superficial character, and such
a one we wish he had applied himself
to produce. From no one could it
better proceed than from a British
officer of intelligence and education.
We are not disposed, however, because
Captain Kennedy has not fulfilled
all our expectations, to judge
with severity the printed results of
his tour. His tone is easy and gentlemanly,
and we are far from crying
down what we presume to be his first
literary attempt.</p>

<p>From the English officer we turn to
the French one, whose book is of a
much more ambiguous character.
Who is this Count St Marie? Whence
does he derive his countship and his
melodramatic or vaudevilleish name?
Does he write in English, or is his
book translated? Is he a Frenchman
as well as a French officer, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonâ fide</i>
human being, or a publisher’s myth;
a flesh and blood author, or a cloak
for a compilation? From sundry little
discrepancies, we suspect the latter;
and that he is indebted for name, title,
and rank, to the ingenious benevolence
of his editor. Sometimes he talks as
if he were a Frenchman; at others,
in a manner to make us suppose him
English. Whatever his nation, it is
strange, if he has been an officer in
the French service, that he should request
information from a certain mysterious
Mr R——, whom he constantly
puts forward as an authority, on the
subject of promotion in the French
army, and respecting French military
decorations. The commanders of the
Legion of Honour, he tells us, wear
the gold cross <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en sautoir</i>, like the
cross of St Andrew. Odd enough
that Count St Marie should be more
conversant with Scottish decorations
than with French ones. Talking of
Bougia, at page 203, he remarks that
“the blindness and imbecility of the
French in Africa <em>is</em> (he might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
said <em>are</em>) more perceptible there than
any where else;” and adverts to “the
ruined <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débarcadère</i>, the fragments of
which seem left only to put French
negligence to shame.” We doubt if
any Frenchman would have written
in this tone, especially in a book intended
for publication in England.
There are many similar passages in
the volume. Yet the gallant count
talks of the French consul as “<em>our</em>
consul,” and of the French troops as
“<em>our</em> columns,” the latter in the very
same paragraph in which he sneers at
their victories. His style is free from
foreign idioms, but here and there occurs
a peculiarity seeming to denote a
translation. A town is said to be
garrisoned by veteran troops, when
the meaning evidently is, that the
garrison was a detachment of the
French corps known as “the Veterans.”
Although <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cent sous</i> is a common
term in France to express a five-franc
piece, in English we do not talk
of a payment of one hundred sous.
But it is unnecessary to multiply instances.
We have probably said
enough to make our readers coincide
in our suspicion, that “Algeria in
1845,” by Count St Marie, is neither
fish, flesh, nor red herring, but altogether
of the composite order. It is,
nevertheless, amusing and full of anecdote,
with only here and there a blunder
or dash of exaggeration; and
although, as we believe, a compilation,
it is tolerably correct in its statistics
and inferences. We must protest,
however, against the humbug of the
system. A book that has merit may
be launched under its true colours,
and kept afloat without a titled name
upon the title-page.</p>

<p>The motives that induce the French
to cling, with a tenacity which an immense
annual outlay of treasure and human
life has hitherto failed to weaken,
to their African conquest, are, we believe,
pretty well appreciated, at least
in this country, where colonies and
colonization are understood, and where
French policy is studied by many. Algeria
is the safety-valve by which the
superfluous steam of the national character
is in some measure let off; it
affords a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">point de mire</i> for the people,
occupation for the army, a subject of
discussion for the newspapers. Doubtless
a large section of the French
nation, or at least of its more sensible
and thinking classes, would gladly
witness the abandonment of a colony
which has already cost more than
there is any probability of its yielding
for years to come—more, perhaps, than
it ever will yield, either in direct or
indirect advantages. But were it proposed
to give it up, the general cry
would be loudly against the measure.
Not that there is a probability of the
proposal being made. The present
shrewd and wary ruler of France well
knows that a little blood-letting is as
essential to keep down the feverish
temperament of his people as a plaything
is to occupy their thoughts and
preserve them from mischief. Algeria
is at once the leech and the toy.
Restless and enterprising spirits there
find the field of action they require;
those who might otherwise be busy
with home politics, have their attention
diverted by battles and bulletins.
The evils of protracted and unprofitable
warfare do not, in this instance,
come home to the nation in a very
direct and palpable form, and therefore
disgust at the resultless strife has not
yet replaced the interest and excitement
it creates. Now and then a tent or
an umbrella is captured and stuck up in
the gardens of the Tuileries to be gaped
and wondered at by the Parisians.
This gives a fillip to popular enthusiasm,
and well-fed national guardsmen,
as they take their turn of duty at the
palace gates, look with increased respect
and envy upon the Algerine
schako and bronzed visage of their
fellow sentry of the line. Captain
Kennedy gives an amusing instance of
the extent to which the martial ardour
of sober French citizens is sometimes
carried by that stir of arms and
din of battle whose echoes are wafted
to their ears from the distant shores
of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>“Among the various costumes and
styles of dress seen in the streets of
Algiers, none are so ridiculous as that
of the European civilian, dressed <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à
l’Arabe</i>, some fine specimens of which
we saw to-day. One of this genus, a
wealthy shopkeeper from the Rue
Chaussée d’Antin, had, by his adventures
a short time since, created some
little amusement. Enthusiastic on the
subject of the new colony, his thoughts
by day had been for months of Algiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
and his dreams by night of bournoused
warriors, fiery steeds, and
bloody yataghans. At last, determined
to see with his own eyes, he
left his beloved Paris, and arrived
safely in Algiers.</p>

<p>“His first care was to procure a
complete Arab dress, in which he sallied
forth the morning after his arrival.
He came in search of adventures,
and he was soon gratified.
Stalking along, he accidentally hustled
a couple of French soldiers, was sworn
at, thrashed, and rolled in the mud as
a ‘Sacré cochon d’Arabe,’ lost his
purse from having no pockets in his
new garments, and was nearly kicked
down stairs by the garçon of his hotel
for venturing to enter his own room.</p>

<p>“Undismayed by these misadventures,
he set out the following day,
armed to the teeth, to ride to Blidah.
When, half-way there, he was seized
as a suspicious character by two Arab
gendarmes, for being armed without
having a permit, and pretending not
to understand Arabic; he was disarmed
and dismounted, his hands tied
behind his back, and fastened to his
captor’s stirrup. He spent the night
on the ground in a wretched hut, with
a handful of cuscusoo for supper, and
next morning was dragged into Algiers
in broad daylight, half dead with
fear and fatigue. On being carried before
the police he was instantly liberated;
and, taking advantage of the
first packet, returned to France, having
seen more of life in Algeria in a
few days, than many who had spent
the same number of years in the colony.”</p>

<p>Great must have been the discomfiture
of the worthy burgher, although
he had much reason to rejoice at having
encountered Arab gendarnes and
French troopers, instead of Bedouins
or Kabyles, who would hardly have
let him off with a beating, a night’s
imprisonment, and a cuscusoo supper.
We can imagine his delight at again
finding the asphalte of the Boulevards
under his boot-soles, and the respect
with which his coffee-house gossips
regarded him, as he related, over his
post-prandial <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">demi-tasse</i>, or in the intervals
of his game at dominos, the
adventures of his amateur campaign,
and the perils that beset the pilgrim
to Algeria. A slight traveller’s license
would convert the pair of gendarmes
into a troop of hostile cavalry,
and his brief detention in the hut into
a visit to the dungeons of Abd-el-Kader.
His friends would look up to
him as a military authority, his wife
exclaim at the injustice that left his
button-hole undecorated; and when
next his company of the national guard
elected their officers, he would have
but to present himself to be instantly
chosen. The laurels he had failed to
achieve in Africa would be bestowed
upon him by acclamation in the guard-room
of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrondissement</i>.</p>

<p>In relating the well-known incident
that gave rise to hostilities between
France and the Dey of Algiers, Count
St Marie goes back to the remote
cause, which, by his account, was a
lady. In the time of Napoleon the
Bey of Tunis had a favourite female
slave, for whom he ordered, of an Algerine
Jew, a costly and magnificent
head-dress. The Jew, unable to get
it manufactured in the country, wrote
to Paris; the head-dress was made, at
an expense of twelve thousand francs,
and the modest Israelite charged it
thirty thousand to the Bey. The latter
was too much pleased with the bauble
to demur at the price, but, not being
in cash, he paid for it in corn. There
chanced just then to be a scarcity in
France; the Jew sold his grain to the
army contractors, and managed so well
that he became a creditor of the French
government for upwards of a million
of francs. Napoleon fell, and the
Bourbons declined to pay; but the
Jew contrived to interest the Dey of
Algiers in his cause, and remonstrances
were addressed to the French government.
The affair dragged on for
years, and at last, in 1829, on the eve
of a festival when the diplomatic
corps were admitted to pay their respects
to the Dey, the latter expostulated
with the French consul on the
subject of the long delay. The answer
was unsatisfactory, and the consequence
was the celebrated rap with a
fan or fly-flap, which sent its giver into
exile, and converted Algeria into a
French province. On visiting the
Kasbah, or citadel, at Algiers, Captain
Kennedy was shown the little room
in which the insult was offered to the
representative of France. It is now
used as a poultry-yard. “Singularly
enough,” says the captain, “as we
entered, a cock, strutting on the deserted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
divan, proclaimed his victory
over some feebler rival by triumphant
crow—an appropriate emblem
of the real state of affairs.” But the
conquered cock is game; and although
sorely punished by his adversary’s
spurs, he returns again and again to
the charge.</p>

<p>Within the fortress of the Kasbah
were comprised the Dey’s palace,
harem, and treasury. The buildings
are now greatly altered, at least as
regards their application. The private
residence of the Dey has been converted
into officers’ quarters, the harem
is occupied by artillerymen, a kiosk
has been arranged as an hospital, and
a mosque has become a Catholic chapel.
The treasury was said to contain an
immense sum at the time of its capture
by the French; but the exact
amount was never known, and various
accounts have been given of the probable
disposal of the money. Captain
Kennedy believes there is little doubt
that the sum of forty-three millions of
francs, officially acknowledged to have
been shipped to France, was employed
by the ministers of Charles the Tenth
in their vain endeavours to suppress
the revolution of 1830. Certain general
officers of the invading army have
been charged with acts of appropriation;
but nothing was ever proved,
and the whole rests on rumour and
unsupported assertion. However the
money was got rid of, there is no
doubt that a vast deal was found.
The Dey, a careless extravagant old
dog, worthy of his piratical ancestors,
was any thing but minute
in his record of receipts and expenditure.
He was not the man to
ring his sovereign or mark his bank-notes;
he knew as much about double
entry as about the Greek mythology
or the Waverley novels, and kept his
accounts with a shovel and a corn-bin.
Wooden partitions divided his treasury
into compartments—one for gold,
one for silver, and separating foreign
and native coin; when money was
received, it was thrown in uncounted;
when wanted, it was taken out without
form or ceremony of writing. “Such
also was the carelessness shown,” adds
Captain Kennedy, “that, in one part,
the walls still bear the impressions of
coins cast in at random, before the
inner coating of plaster had had time
to dry,”—quite a realisation of fairy
tale accounts, and popular ideas of
Oriental profusion and lavish prodigality.
The manner in which these
heads of gold and silver were guarded
is equally curious, and completes a
picture worthy of the Arabian Nights’
Entertainments. “Prior to the French
occupation,” says M. St Marie, “any
attempt to penetrate into these caves
was impracticable, the approach to
them being guarded by lions, tigers
and hyenas, chained up at short distances
from each other.” Besides
these formidable brute body-guards,
whose melodious voices must have
greatly soothed the slumbers of the
fair inmates of the seraglio, the Dey
had barracks within the Kasbah for
his household troops, on whose fidelity
he relied for protection from the soldiery
of the regency, frequently in a
state of mutiny.</p>

<p>Military hospitals are of course a
primary necessity in a country where
half a million of soldiers have perished
during the last fifteen years, either by
disease or the sword. At Algiers there
are several establishments of the kind,
one of which, situated in the gardens
of the Dey, and capable of containing
five thousand sick, is particularly worthy
of notice. Large as the building
is, it is insufficient in summer and
autumn to accommodate all who seek
admission. The gardens have been
left as much as possible uninjured,
and their orange-trees and fountains
afford cool shade and delightful freshness
to the convalescent soldiers. On
the other hand, the Jardin Marengo,
belonging to Colonel Marengo, the
commandant of the citadel of Algiers,
contributes its quota to the sick wards.
It is cultivated, Count St Marie informs
us, by condemned soldiers, who
suffer dreadfully from the heat and
from exposure to the burning sun.
Scarcely a day passes without some
of the unfortunate men being conveyed
to hospital, and in many instances they
never recover. The real name of
Colonel Marengo is Capon. His father
distinguished himself at the battle
of Marengo, and Napoleon jestingly
bestowed on him the name retained
by his son, instead of the ignoble
appellation that he previously bore.
Apropos of the hospital—or it might
just as well be said, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">àpropos de bottes</i>—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Count, who certainly never loses
an opportunity of bringing in a good
story, relates one of a M. St Vincent,
president of a French learned society,
who went to Africa to prosecute researches
in natural history. Eager
for specimens, he was liberal in his
payments; and one day a great curiosity
was brought to him in the shape
of two rats, each with a long excrescence,
like the trunk of an elephant,
issuing from the top of the nose. He
caught at the prize, and immediately
forwarded to the Jardin des Plantes
at Paris a scientific description of the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rat trompé</i>. But his letter had scarcely
gone when the excrescence became
dry and dropped off; and on examination
it was found that incisions had
been made above the noses of the
animals, and the tails of two other rats
inserted The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rat trompé</i> dwindled
into a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rat trompeur</i>.</p>

<p>After a short stay in the city of
Algiers, and contemplating a return
thither, Captain Kennedy and his
companion, Viscount Fielding, started
for Blidah by diligence. At about
half a mile from the Kasbah, the road—an
excellent one, constructed by the
troops—passes under the walls of Fort
l’Empereur, built in commemoration
of a victory obtained by the Moors
in the year 1541 over the troops of
Charles V. Some of the cannon abandoned
on this occasion by the Spaniards
were originally French, having been
taken by the imperial army at the battle
of Pavia. The Algerines mounted
them on the Kasbah, where they remained
until in 1830, after an interval
of three hundred and five years,
they again fell into the hands of their
first possessors. The fort, which owes
its existence to a signal triumph of
Algerine power, was not destined
to survive the downfall of the Crescent.
Invested by the French, a few
hours’ cannonade dismounted its guns,
breached its walls, and ruined its defences.
The garrison were compelled
to abandon it, and retreat into the
city, with the exception of a few desperadoes,
who had sworn to perish,
but never to fly before the Christians.
Whilst the French troops impatiently
awaited orders for an assault, a tremendous
explosion took place; and
when the dust and smoke cleared
away, the whole western face of the
fort was a heap of ruins. The surrender
of the city shortly followed.</p>

<p>Previously to an earthquake that
occurred in 1825, the town of Blidah,
situated in a fertile valley at the foot
of the lesser Atlas, numbered fifteen
thousand inhabitants. Many of these
perished in the ruins of their dwellings,
and the place never recovered
itself; for, at the period of the French
invasion, the population was only five
thousand. Placed in the very heart
of the scene of war, the diminution
continued, and the native inhabitants
are now an insignificant handful. The
European population is on the increase,
and the situation of the town on the
line of communication between the
port of Algiers and the country beyond
the Atlas, as well as its good climate
and abundance of water, seems to
mark it out as a place of future importance.
In former times it was a
favourite residence of the Moors and
Arabs, who called it the New Damascus.
There has been hard fighting
there during the present war, and it
has thrice changed masters. It is
surrounded by luxuriant gardens and
groves of orange-trees, whose fruit is
said to be the finest in the world.
The plantations formerly extended
quite up to the town; but the Arabs
took advantage of this to come down
and pick off the sentries, and it was
found necessary to clear a large number
of acres. This impoverished many
of the inhabitants, whose wealth consisted
in plantations of oranges, lemons,
and olives. The town is usually garrisoned
by the Zouaves, troops originally
raised amongst the natives in imitation
of our Sepoys. Soon after the formation
of the corps, however, Frenchmen were
allowed and encouraged to enlist, and
of these the three battalions now principally
consist. As fighting men they
enjoy the highest possible character,
but in quarters they are terrible scamps.
Its gallant reputation and picturesque
uniform, and the numerous opportunities
of distinction afforded to it, cause
this corps to be generally preferred by
volunteers, and non-commissioned officers
often leave the line to serve as
privates in the Zouaves.</p>

<p>At Blidah, Captain Kennedy and
his friend procured horses, and with
their party strengthened by two Prussian
officers, they set out for Medeah.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
West of the river Chiffa they came
upon another military road, at which
a battalion was then working. Men
and officers were encamped in tents,
and in huts constructed of boughs.
“The men employed on this duty
receive seventy-five centimes (about
sevenpence) additional pay per diem;
and during the winter and spring, as
the work is not hard, it is rather preferred
by the troops to garrison duty.”
The system of providing employment
for the soldier, when he is not actually
opposed to the enemy, is very generally
carried out by the French in
their African colony, and also in
France when it is possible to be done.
Captain Kennedy evidently approves
of it. At Medeah, a few minutes’
walk from the gate, are the gardens
of the garrison. Each regiment or
battalion has its piece of ground, divided
into lots for the different companies,
and supplying the troops with
vegetables. “Here, as at other places
I have since visited, the ground in the
occupation of the troops was in a high
state of culture, and superior both in
produce and neatness of arrangement
to the gardens of the civilians. * * *
In many of our own colonies, and even
at home, this system might be followed
with beneficial results to our
troops; for, putting aside the addition
the produce would make to the
comforts of the men, any employment
or amusement that would tend to
keep the soldier out of the canteen or
public-house during his leisure hours,
and there are many on whom it would
have that effect, must be advantageous.”</p>

<p>Medeah is the capital of the province
of Tittery, and the head-quarters
of a subdivision of the French
army, commanded by General Marey,
to whom Captain Kennedy had introductions.
To these the general did
all honour, and sketched out for his
guests the plan of an expedition to
the Little Sahara. A French traveller,
recording his visit to Medeah,
has given the following ludicrous and
melancholy account of the caravanserais
of the town. “On a déjà
plusieurs cafés avec l’inévitable billard,
et deux hôtels où le travail est
divisé, car l’un loge and l’autre nourrit;
les chambres n’y sont pas encore
tout à-fait meublées, et le charpentier
n’a pas encore achevé l’escalier qui y
monte. On y a oublié une certaine
faience très utile, mais il y a déjà des
miroirs.” This description, doubtless
as true as it is characteristic, now no
longer applies. Things have improved
in the last year or two; and at the
time of Captain Kennedy’s journey,
the Medeah hotels were very tolerable.
But he was eager for the desert,
and tarried little in the town. Accompanied
by an aide-de-camp of
General Marey, who had volunteered
to do the honours of the colony, and
show to the English visitors life
amongst the Bedouins, escorted also
by a score of light infantry, a party
of Spahis or native cavalry, by half a
dozen officers of the garrison, several
servants, and a vast number of dogs,
our travellers struck into the Arab
country. The district they were about
to traverse being peopled by friendly
tribes, this large attendance was less
for purposes of protection to the Englishmen
than of mischief to the wild-boars,
which it was proposed to hunt.
After a night passed in an Arab tent,
the battue began; and although not
very successful, only one boar being
killed, the sportsmen deemed themselves
well repaid for eight hours’
walk in a broiling sun, by magnificent
scenery, and the excitement of the
chase.</p>

<p>There is interest, although no very
great novelty, in Captain Kennedy’s
narrative of his wanderings amongst
the <em>dasheras</em> and <em>douars</em> of the Bedouins.
The douars are Arab camps,
the dasheras villages, or rather collections
of huts, built of stone and
mud, and roofed with branches of
trees. The walls of these miserable
habitations are low; the door does
duty as sole window; for a fireplace
a hole is made in the earthen door;
the furniture consists of a few mats, a
corn-mill, some pots, and a lamp.
These are the dwellings of the agricultural
tribes, who live near the
mountains. The pastoral tribes roam
over the desert; their tents, corn-mills,
and mats, packed upon camels;
and driving with them flocks and
herds of sheep, goats, and cattle.
When they halt, the tents are pitched
in a circle, the opening towards the
east; and at night the animals are
driven into the inclosure, for safety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
from robbers, and to prevent straying.
A family of Arabs will frequently
wander several days’ march from their
usual abiding-place to some French
garrison or settlement, there to barter
their stock for corn and European
produce. They travel by easy journeys,
and halt whenever convenient,
only taking care to keep out of the
way of hostile tribes. “A short time
serves to unload the camel, spread
the mats, and pitch the tent. A few
handfuls of corn, ground in the mill,
kneaded into a paste with water, and
baked in thin cakes on the fire, with
a drink of water, or, if they have it,
milk, forms their simple meal.” Such
is the abstemious life of these sons of
the desert. In the autumn, when the
great fair is held at Boghar, the advanced
post of the French on the side
of the Little Sahara, several thousand
people repair thither, bringing hides,
cheese, butter, and wool; also dates,
skins of beasts, ostrich feathers, and
the woollen manufactures of the Arab
women, received from the interior of
the country. These various products
are exchanged for honey, oil, corn,
cutlery, and cotton cloths. Arms
and ammunition used to be greatly in
request, but the French have prohibited
that traffic. The imports of
European goods are on the increase,
and Captain Kennedy considers French
trade in the north of Africa in a highly
improving state, favoured as it is by
numerous roads, made or making,
through the Atlas, by the pacification
of the country, and submission of the
tribes between Blidah and Boghar.
How long this submission may last
must be considered doubtful. It has
been induced neither by love nor fear,
but by self-interest. The more prosperous
tribes, and those located in the
plain, finding Abd-el-Kader unable
to protect them, took the only means
left to secure themselves from the
fierce razzias of the French, and from
the ruin that these entailed. So long
as they deem it advantageous, they
will doubtless be staunch to their
compact; but let then see or imagine
a probable change in the fortune of
the war, and they will be found eager,
as some of them have already shown
themselves, to rally once more round
the standard of the Emir.</p>

<p>Amongst the tribes whose hospitality
was shared by Captain Kennedy,
the most powerful was that of
Ouled-Macktar, whose chief, Ben
Douda, is considered by the captain
to afford a good type of the Arab
chiefs in the pay of France. For a
long period he acted as one of Abd-el-Kader’s
lieutenants, but at a critical
moment transferred his services
to the French. His people had their
possessions secured to them, and he
himself received the appointment of
Aga over the Arabs of the Little
Desert, with an allowance of ten per
cent on the tribute paid by the tribes
under his jurisdiction. He is described
as about fifty years of age,
with handsome though harsh features
of the true Arab cast. “What struck
me most in his appearance, was the
expression of deep cunning strongly
marked in the lines that crossed his
forehead, and in the downcast and
furtive glances of the eye, observing
every thing, yet seemingly inattentive.”
The Aga is very wealthy, and
lives in great luxury, comparatively
to most of the Arabs. Captain Kennedy’s
party reached his camp at a
fortunate moment. The douar was
in an unusual state of excitement,
and great rejoicings were on foot in
honour of the marriage of the Aga’s
son. The wedding-feast, consisting
of sheep roasted whole, stewed gazelle,
cuscusoo, and other Bedouin
delicacies, was succeeded by some
very graceless dances. Whilst the
latter proceeded, the men kept up an
irregular fire of guns, pistols, and
blunderbusses, presenting their weapons
at each others’ breasts, and suddenly
dropping the muzzle at the
moment of pulling the trigger, so that
the charge struck the ground. As
might be anticipated, this dangerous
sport did not terminate without an
accident. One young savage omitted
to sink his muzzle, and sent a blank
cartridge into the hip of a comrade,
knocking him over, burning his bournous,
and causing an ugly, although
not a dangerous wound. “The rest
of the party did not seem to care much
about it, and the wounded man’s wife,
instead of looking after her husband,
rushed up to the man who had shot
him, and, assisted by some female
friends, opened upon him a torrent of
abuse, with such fluency of tongue and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
command of language, that, after endeavouring
in vain to get in a word
or two, he fairly turned tail and
walked off.”</p>

<p>In the douar of the Abides tribe,
Captain Kennedy fell in with a scorpion-eater.
This was a disgusting-looking
boy, who, being an idiot, was
looked upon by the Arabs as a saint—deprivation
of intellect constituting in
their opinion a high claim to holiness.
This urchin bolted, sting and
all, a fine lively scorpion upwards of
two inches long—the reptile writhing
between his teeth as he deliberately
crunched it. Our traveller had heard
of such exploits, but had naturally
been rather incredulous concerning
the non-removal of the sting. In this
case, however, he was perfectly satisfied
that no deception was practised.
The boy afterwards devoured another
of the same dangerous species of vermin.
He belonged to the religious
sect of the Aisaoua, who claim the
privilege of being proof against the
venom of reptiles and the effects of
fire. A most extraordinary account
of a festival of this sect has been given
by a French officer, of whose narrative
Captain Kennedy supplies a translation.
Fortunately he does not vouch
for its veracity; so we may be permitted
to disbelieve one half and
doubt the rest. M. St Marie relates
some marvels of a similar description,
collected from an interpreter who had
been a prisoner of Abd-el-Kader.</p>

<p>The general impression made on us
by Captain Kennedy’s account of his
visit to the Arab tribes, is, that the
French have as yet done little or nothing
towards securing the affections
and improving the condition of the
people they have subjugated. It must
be acknowledged that they have had
to do with an intractable race, and
one difficult to conciliate. The old
hatred and contempt of Mussulmans
towards Christians has been preserved
in full force in the deserts and mountains
of Northern Africa. Centuries
have done nothing to weaken it, or to
cause the followers of Mahomet to
look with liking, or even tolerance,
upon the children of the Cross. The
Christian is still a dog, and the son
of a dog; and even when crouching
before his power and intelligence, the
Arab nurtures hopes of revenge, long
deferred but never abandoned. The
French regard their conquest as
secure; and doubtless it may be
rendered so by the maintenance of a
powerful military establishment; but
who can foretell the time when they
will be enabled to withdraw even a
portion of their present African army?
Their doing so would be a signal for
revolt amongst the chiefs now in their
pay, amongst the tribes apparently
most effectually humbled and subdued.
Patience and vindictiveness are
distinguishing traits of the Arab. He
bides his time, but never loses sight
of his object and of his revenge.
“They do not forget,” says Count St
Marie, speaking of the Arabs of the
province of Oran, “that the Spaniards,
weary of occupying a territory which
cost them great sacrifices, and yielded
them no advantages, abandoned their
conquest after two centuries of possession.
They foresee that, one day
or other, they will be rid of the
French, who have made as great a
mistake as the Spaniards. The Arabs
are animated by an innate spirit of
pride and independence which nothing
can subdue.” We venture no prophecies
in this sense, but neither can we
predict the day when Algeria, as a
colony, will become other than an unproductive
burden to its present possessors,
or when it will repay them
for the blood and treasure they so
liberally expend upon it. They should
beware of arguing too favourably from
apparent calm and submission on the
part of the natives. The ocean is
often smoothest before a storm; the
Arab most dangerous when apparently
most tranquil. Like other Orientals,
he starts in an instant from torpor and
indolence into the fiercest activity.
“The Arab,” says a German officer,
whose narrative of adventure in
Africa has recently been rendered into
English, “lies whole days before his
tent, wrapped in his bournous, and leaning
his head on his hand. His horse
stands ready saddled, listlessly hanging
his head almost to the ground,
and occasionally casting sympathising
glances at his master. The African
might then be supposed phlegmatic
and passionless, but for the occasional
flash of his wild dark eye, which
gleams from under his bushy brows.
His rest is like that of the Numidian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
lion, which, when satisfied, stretches
itself beneath a shady palm-tree—but
beware of waking him! Like the
beasts of the desert and the forest, and
like all nature in his own land, the
Arab is hurried from one extreme to
the other, from the deepest repose to
the most restless activity. At the
first sound of the tam-tam, his foot is
in the stirrup, his hand on his rifle,
and he is no longer the same man.
He rides day and night, bears every
privation, and braves every danger,
in order to make prize of a sheep or
ass, or of some enemy’s head. Such
men as these are hard to conquer, and
harder still to govern: were they
united into one people, they would
form a nation which would not only
repulse the French, but bid defiance
to the whole world. Unhappily for
them, every tribe is at enmity with
the rest; and this must ultimately
lead to their destruction, for the
French have already learned to match
African against African.”</p>

<p>The constant hostilities amongst
the tribes have doubtless facilitated
their conquest; and the French still
act upon the maxim of “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">divide et impera</i>,”
as the best means to retain
what they have won. As yet little
attention has been paid to more
humane means of strengthening themselves
in their new possessions, and
to the civilisation of the natives. The
chief plan proposed for the attainment
of the latter object, has been to subject
to the conscription all Arabs born
since the occupation of the country
by the French. It is very doubtful
what may be the effect of this measure
should it be carried out. Will it
Frenchify the natives, and induce
kindly feelings towards their conquerors,
or render them more dogged and
dangerous than before? They will, at
any rate, acquire military knowledge,
and an acquaintance with the European
system of warfare, which, combined
with the skill in arms and horsemanship
they already possess, will
render them doubly dangerous in case
of a revolt. After their seven years’
service, they may perhaps think fit to
join Abd-el-Kader, or any other leader
then warring against the French. It
is want of proper discipline that has
rendered the Arab cavalry unable to
compete successfully with that of
France. They charge tumultuously
and with little order, each man relying
much upon himself individually,
but doing little to aid the combined
effect of the mass.</p>

<p>Might not conversion to Christianity
be made a powerful lever for the civilisation
of the tribes? They entertain
a degree of respect for the Catholic
priests scarcely inferior to that shown
to their own marabouts. Abd-el-Kader
has more than once released
a prisoner, without ransom, at the
prayer of the Bishop of Algiers. Near
the last-named city, some French
Jesuits have formed an establishment
for the education, in the Christian
faith, of young Arabs and Moors.
There, as the author of “Algeria in
1845” informs us, a certain number of
youths, after being baptized, are fed,
clothed, lodged, and instructed in
some trade. The French government
pays little attention to this establishment,
which is supported chiefly by
charitable contributions. “It is, however,
a great work of civilisation. The
young pupils are hostages in the hands
of the French. It is pretty certain
that their fathers, brothers, and relations,
will not join the rebels. When
they leave this establishment, they
will carry with them indelible feelings
of gratitude. They will have an occupation,
they will speak the French
language, and will be of the same religion
as their masters.”</p>

<p>Exclusive of the army, Frenchmen
form less than half of the European
population of Algeria. After
them come Spaniards, who are very
numerous; then Maltese and Italians;
and finally, a small number of Germans,
barely five per cent of the
whole. The Spaniard, although often
taxed with idleness and dislike to
labour, here proves himself an industrious
and valuable colonist; the Maltese
travels from village to village with
his little stock of merchandise; the
German tills the ground. In the
neighbourhood of Algiers, things have
a very European aspect; and the
Arabs themselves, from constant intercourse
with the city, have lost
much of their nationality. The appearance
of a flourishing colony is,
however, confined to this district.
Little progress has as yet been
made in rebuilding the other towns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
although in most of them the work of
improvement is begun, and the narrow
dirty streets are being pulled
down to make room for wider avenues
and more commodious houses.
In some of them the only buildings as
yet erected are barracks and hospitals.
The seaport town of Bona, bordering
on the regency of Tunis, is an exception.
In 1832 it was reduced to
ruins by the troops of the Bey of
Constantina, under command of Ben
Aïssa. It is now rebuilding on the
European plan. A large square, with
a fountain, has been laid out in its
centre, and several well-built streets
are completed. The town already
boasts of an opera, with an Italian
company, who are assisted by amateurs,
chiefly Germans, from the ranks
of the foreign legion.</p>

<p>The Algerine Jews attribute their
first arrival in Africa to a miracle, of
which we find the following version
in Count St Marie’s book. In the
year 1390, Simon-ben-Sinia, chief
rabbi of Seville, and sixty of his co-religionists
were imprisoned, and condemned
to die, the object being to get
possession of their wealth. On the
eve of the day fixed for their execution,
Simon drew the image of a ship
on his prison wall. The drawing was
miraculously changed into a real
vessel, on board of which the prisoners
embarked for Algiers, where they were
kindly received by the Marabout Sidi
Ben Yusef. This tradition is still an
article of faith, even with the most
enlightened of the Jews. In whatever
manner they came, they have
increased and multiplied, and now
abound in all the towns of Algeria.
Preserving the characteristics of their
race, they differ little from their
European brethren; or, if there be any
difference, it is not much in their
favour. Their moral condition is low;
and although some honourable and
honest men are found amongst them,
the majority are of a very different
stamp. They are charitable to their
poor, and hospitable to their own people,
and are generally well conducted;
but their insatiable and inherent
greed leads them into all sorts of disgraceful
transactions. They have
been immense gainers by the expulsion
of the Deys, under whose rule
they were subjected to much oppression
and ill usage. “Their condition is
now vastly ameliorated, and I have
even heard complaints of their insolence;
a very extraordinary charge
against a race so tamed and broken
in spirit. The French, I fear, can
place but little reliance on their
courage in occasions of danger.” The
Jewish women, when young, are for
the most part strikingly handsome;
and the boys are models of beauty
until the age of ten or eleven years,
when their features grow coarse.
Education is confined to the males.</p>

<p>The taming of savage animals is no
uncommon amusement amongst the
French in Algeria; and the most
extraordinary and alarming pets are
encountered not only in officers’
quarters but in ladies’ drawing-rooms.
At Medeah, Captain Kennedy was
introduced to a magnificent lion, the
property of General Marey, Sultan by
name, two years old, and of a most
amiable and docile disposition. Sultan
allowed himself to be examined and
pulled about, and did not even exhibit
anger, but some annoyance when an
aide-de-camp puffed a cigar in his
nostrils—a pleasantry which we are
disposed to consider fool-hardy. The
only thing that excited his ire was a
Scotch plaid worn by Captain Kennedy.
It was supposed that the
hanging ends reminded him of an
Arab bournous, to which he had shown
great aversion, having probably been
ill-treated in his infancy by the Arabs
who caught him. Notwithstanding
his good temper, the general intended
to get rid of him, fearing that in the
long run instinct might prove stronger
than education. Besides the lion,
General Marey had an unhappy-looking
eagle, and a pair of beautiful
gazelles. Count St Marie abounds
in anecdotes of ferocious beasts in
a state of civilisation. One of
the first acquaintances he made in
Algiers was a tame hyena, of most
unamiable aspect, but who lived in
touching amity with a little dog, and
did the civil for lumps of sugar. At
Bona, the count went to call upon
some ladies, and, on opening the door,
beheld a brace of lions walking about
the room. He shut himself out with
great precipitation, but was presently
reassured by the fair proprietresses
of these singular favourites. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
he ventured into the saloon, and sat
down, the lion laid his head upon his
knee, and the lioness jumped on the
divan beside her mistress. These
brutes were seven years old. Lions
are not very common in Algeria.
Now and then they approach the
douars, greatly to the alarm of the
Arabs, who hasten to inform the
French authorities, and a battue takes
place. Accidents generally happen
at these lion-hunts: Count St Marie
affirms that there are always three or
four lives lost, to say nothing of
wounds and other serious injuries.
Whilst passing the night in an Arab
encampment at the entrance of the
Bibans or Iron Gates—the scene of
much hard fighting, and of a gallant
exploit of the late Duke of Orleans—the
count was roused, he informs us,
in the dead of the night, “by a noise
which appeared to me like a distant
peal of thunder, repeated and prolonged
by the mountain echoes. Gradually
the noise became louder. The
animals sprang from their resting-places,
and the men, armed with muskets,
rushed out of the tents. The
oxen, grouped themselves together, and
turned their horns to the enemy; the
dogs were afraid even to bark. Presently
the roaring became less frequent
and more distant; and we
found that we had been saved from
the unwelcome visit of a lion, by the
light of the burning brushwood on the
neighbouring hills.” The boar and
the jackal are more common and less
dangerous objects of chase than the
lion. Some of the rich colonists and
many of the officers are ardent sportsmen.
Two of the former have regular
packs of hounds and studs of horses.
Hares, rabbits, and red partridges are
very common.</p>

<p>The horse has greatly degenerated
in Algeria, owing chiefly to the neglect
of the Arabs, who consider the
choice of the dam to be alone important,
and pay no attention to the
qualities of the sire. The French
government has recently established
stables near Bona, with a view to the
improvement of the breed; the stud
is to consist of stallions only. There
are to be similar establishments in the
other two provinces. So great is the
demand for the better class of horses,
that the Arabs obtain very high prices
for their stallions, which they willingly
sell, but they will not part with
the mares. Every year, therefore, it
becomes more difficult to propagate a
good breed. Officers have now been
sent to Tunis to make purchases, at a
limit of eighty ponds sterling for
each horse. This price, Captain Kennedy
says, ought to buy the best
horses in the country. Although
less numerous than formerly, splendid
specimens of the Barbary Arab
are still to be met with in Algeria.
Captain Kennedy describes, in glowing
terms, a magnificent charger
belonging to General Marey, purchased
by that officer at a high price,
and after a long negotiation, from a
wealthy chief in the south-west. M.
St Marie says, that he knew a Morocco
horse to perform fifty leagues
in eleven hours, without turning a
hair or showing a trace of the spur.
Assuming him to speak of the common
three-mile league, or even of the
old French posting league, which was
something less, this statement appears
incredible. Thirteen miles and a half
an hour! Dick Turpin himself, upon
his fabulous mare, would have recoiled
before such a pace sustained for such
a time. The rate of marching of the
Arabs, however, from Captain Kennedy’s
evidence, is very rapid. The
infantry do their fifteen or twenty
leagues in the twenty-four hours—the
cavalry from thirty to forty-five—the
<em>meharies</em> (so say the Arabs) from
fifty to eighty. This is when the tribes
are on the war-path, making razzias
upon each other’s flocks and camps,
when it may be supposed that they
put on a little extra steam. The mehary
is an inferior race of camel, with
a small hump, and possessed of considerable
strength and spirit, carrying
a couple of men. It keeps up for the
whole day at about the same speed as
the ordinary trot of a horse. Its diet
is herbs and date kernels. The horses
of the Sahara thrive best upon dates
and milk; few of them get barley;
and they are sometimes reduced, when
no other food is obtainable, to eat
cooked meat.</p>

<p>Amongst the most determined enemies
of the French in Africa, are to
be enumerated the Kabyles, tribes
dwelling in the ranges of the Lesser
Atlas, from Tunis to Morocco. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
different race from the Arabs, they
are believed to be the aboriginal inhabitants
of Northern Africa. Secure
in their wild valleys, they have ever
preserved their independence. Carthaginians,
Romans, Vandals, Arabs,
all failed to subdue them; and, although
some of the tribes, whose territory
is the least inaccessible, are now
partially under the rule of the French,
the maritime range, from the east of
the Metidjah to Philippeville, remains
unconquered. Their numbers are inconsiderable,
roughly estimated at
eighty thousand. This would give a
fighting population of at most from sixteen
to twenty thousand men; but that
small force has been found efficient to
preserve from foreign domination the
almost impregnable fastnesses in which
they dwell. Although the tribes wage
frequent war amongst themselves, a
common enemy unites them all. The
attachment of the Kabyles to their
country and tribe is remarkable. Like
the Swiss, or the Spanish Galicians,
they are accustomed to wander forth
when young, and seek their fortune in
other lands. Kabyle servants and
labourers are found in all the towns
and villages of Northern Africa. But
if they learn that their tribe is threatened
or at war, they abandon their
situations, however advantageous, and
hasten home, and to arms. They are
very brave, but barbarously cruel,
giving no quarter, and torturing their
prisoners before cutting off their
heads.</p>

<p>Their weapons are guns six or
seven feet long, pistols, and yataghans,
chiefly of their own manufacture,
and the materials for which are found
in their mountains, where they work
mines of copper, lead, and iron. In
their rude way, and considering the
badness of their tools, they are
tolerably ingenious. Amongst other
things, they make counterfeit five-franc
pieces, sufficiently well executed
to take in the less knowing amongst
the Arabs. Their industry is great,
and, besides the valleys, they cultivate
the steep mountain sides, forming
terraces by means of walls, such as are
seen in the vineyards on the Rhine
and in Switzerland. Possessing few
horses, they usually fight on foot; and
in the plain, their untutored courage
is unable to withstand the discipline
of the French troops. Their charges
are furious but disorderly; and when
beaten back, they disperse to rally
again at a distance. In the mountains,
where the advantages of military
organization have less weight,
they are sturdy and dangerous foes,
fighting on the guerilla plan, disputing
each inch of ground, and disappearing
from before their enemy
only to fall with redoubled fierceness
upon his flank or rear. No
foreigners can penetrate into their
country, and even Arabs run great
risk amongst them. Not long ago,
Captain Kennedy informs us, a party
of Arab traders, suspected by the
Kabyles of being in the French interest,
were murdered to a man. Most
of them understand and speak the
Arabic, but they have also a language
of their own, called the Shilla or
Sherwia, whose derivation it has hitherto
been impossible to discover. They
profess Islamism, but mix up with it
many superstitions of their ancestors,
and ascribe certain virtues to the
symbol of the cross, which they use
as a talisman and tattoo upon their
persons. “It would seem from this,”
observes Captain Kennedy, “that at
least the outward forms of the early
Christians had at one period penetrated
into the heart of their mountains.”
That, however, like all that relates
to the early history of the Kabyles,
is enveloped in doubt and obscurity.</p>

<p>A barbarous practice, prevalent in
Algeria before the French invasion,
is still, Count St Marie tells us, adhered
to by the Kabyles. The amputation
of a limb, instead of being
surgically performed, is effected by
blow of a yataghan. The stump is
then dipped into melted pitch, to stop
the bleeding. The barber is the
usual operator. Until the French
came, regular physicians and surgeons
were unknown in Algeria.</p>

<p>Besides the Zouaves already referred
to, the French have raised
various other corps expressly for
African service. Conspicuous amongst
these are two regiments of light
cavalry, composed of picked men, and
known as the “Chasseurs d’Afrique.”
They are mounted on Arab horses;
and in order to obtain a sufficient
supply, each tribe has to furnish a
horse as part of its yearly tribute.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
The arms of the Chasseurs are carbine,
sabre, and pistols; their equipment is
light; their uniform plain, and well
suited to the nature of the service.
Wherever engaged, they have greatly
distinguished themselves, and are proportionably
esteemed in the army of
Africa. The reputation of the Spahis
stands less high. These consist of
four regiments of native cavalry, under
the command of the Arab general
Yussuf, whose history, as related by
M. St Marie, is replete with romantic
incident. It has been said that he is
a native of the island of Elba, and
was captured, when yet a child, by a
Tunisian corsair. Sold to the Bey, he
was placed as a slave in the seraglio,
and there remained until an intrigue
with his master’s daughter compelled
him to seek safety on board a French
brig, then about to join the fleet destined
to attack Algiers. He made the first
campaign as interpreter to the general-in-chief.
His talents and heroic
courage rapidly advanced him, and
when the first regiment of Spahis was
raised, he was appointed its colonel.
Previously to that, he had rendered
great services to the French, especially
at Bona, when that town was attacked
by Ben Aïssa. Landing from a brig
of war with Captain d’Armandy and
thirty sailors, he threw himself into
the citadel, then garrisoned by the
Turkish troops of Ibrahim, the former
Bey of Constantina, who professed to
hold the town for the French government,
but had left his post. The
Turks rose against their new leaders,
and would have murdered them, but
for the energy of Yussuf, who killed
two ringleaders with his own hand, and
then, heading the astounded mutineers,
led them against the besiegers, who
were totally defeated. The exterior
of this dashing chief is exceedingly
elegant and prepossessing. When at
Paris he was called “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le beau Yussuf</i>,”
and caused quite a <em>furore</em>, especially
among the fair sex. His portrait may
still be seen in the various print-shops,
side by side with Lamoricière, Bugeaud,
and the other “great guns” of the
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Armée d’Afrique</i>.”</p>

<p>The first Foreign Legion employed
by the French in Africa was transferred
to Spain in 1835, and there used
up, almost to a man. Another has
since been raised, composed of men of
all countries—Poles, Belgians, Germans
of every denomination, a few
Spanish Carlists, and even two or
three Englishmen; the legion, like
most corps of the same kind, is remarkable
for the reckless valour and
bad moral character of its members.
The Polish battalion is the best and
most distinguished. The others are
not to be trusted; and only a very
severe system of punishments preserves
something like discipline in their
ranks, where adventurers, deserters,
and escaped criminals are the staple
commodity. Bad as they are, they
are eclipsed by the condemned regiments,
known by the slang name of
“Les Zephyrs” These are punished
men, considered ineligible to serve
again in their former regiments, and
who are put together on the principle
of there being no danger of contagion
where all are infected. A taught hand
is kept over them; they are insubordinate in
quarters, but dare-devils in the
field. It will easily be imagined that
the duties assigned to these convict
battalions are neither the most agreeable
nor the least perilous. At present,
however, a detachment is employed on
no unpleasant service, the care of a
experimental military farm, near the
camp of El Arrouch, in the district of
Constantina. Here they cultivate a
considerable tract of land, both farm
and garden, breed cattle, and supply
the colonists with seeds, fruit-trees,
and so forth. Workshops are attached
to the farm, for the manufacture of
agricultural implements. The men
who work as artisans receive three-pence,
and the field labourers three
halfpence, in addition to their daily
pay. “Since the commencement of
the experiment,” says Captain Kennedy,
“the offences that have been
committed bear but a small proportion
to those that formerly occurred
during a similar period in garrison.”
In these days of reform in our military
system, might not some hints be taken
from such innovations as these? If
employment is found to diminish crime
amongst a troop of convicts, it might
surely be expected to do as much
in regiments to which no stigma is
attached, and the vices of those members
are often solely to be attributed
to idleness and its concomitant temptations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Of few men so largely talked of,
and so justly celebrated, is so little
positively known as of Abd-el-Kader.
The contradictory accounts obtained
from the tribes, the narratives of prisoners,
who, from their very condition,
were precluded from gathering other
than partial and uncertain information,
compose all the materials hitherto
afforded for the history of this
remarkable chieftain. Even his age
is a matter of doubt, and has been
variously stated, although it appears
probable that he is now about forty
years old. Seeing the great difficulty
of obtaining authentic information,
Captain Kennedy has abstained from
nore than a brief reference to the
Emir. At the period of his visit, Abd-el-Kader
was not in the field, and his
whereabout was very vaguely known—the
French believing him to be
“somewhere on the frontiers of Morocco.”
In the absence, therefore, of
trustworthy data, and of opportunities
of personal observation, the
captain says little on the subject.
His reserve is unimitated by M. St
Marie, who not only gives a detailed
account of the Arab sultan, but prefixes
to his book a portrait of that
personage, with whom he claims to
have had an interview. As regards
the portrait, it may be as much like
Abd-el-Kader as any other of the
half-dozen we have met with, no two
of which bore any similitude to each
other. The account of the interview
is rather marvellous. During his stay
in the city of Algiers, M. St Marie
went to breakfast with a young Belgian
acquaintance, and found an Arab
seated in his friend’s room, smoking a
pipe. Refreshments were offered to the
stranger, and, whilst he discussed
them, the count had an opportunity
of studying his countenance. He was
struck with the dignity of his manner
and deportment, and with his air of
intellectual superiority, and was given
to understand that he was sheik of a
tribe friendly to the French. Breakfast
over, the Arab departed. Two
days afterwards, M. St Marie met his
Belgian entertainer. “You were very
fortunate the other day,” said the
latter; “the Arab whom you saw,
when breakfasting with me, was no
other than the Emir himself.” And
he proceeded to relate how Abd-el-Kader
had entered the city with a
party of peasants, carrying some chickens,
which he sold in the marketplace,
to prevent suspicion of his real
character. He pledged his word to
the truth of this statement, of whose
accuracy the count appears satisfied.
His readers will possibly be more incredulous.
As a traveller’s story, the
“yarn” may pass muster, and is,
perhaps, not much out of place in the
book where it is found. With it we
conclude our notice of the rival “Algerias.”
Those who desire further
details of Bedouin douars and French
encampments, of camels and Kabyles,
razzias and the like, may seek and
find them in the chronicle of the English
captain, and the varied, but less
authentic pages of the foreign count.</p>

<h2 id="HOUSE">HOW TO BUILD A HOUSE AND LIVE IN IT.</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">No. II.</span></h3>

<p>We spent last Sunday at Figgins’s
at Brixton, No. 2, Albert Terrace,
Woodbine Lane. A hearty fellow:
good glass of port: prime cigar: snug
box in the garden: and a bus every
five minutes at the end of the
road: a regular A.1. place for a Sunday
out, and home again in an hour
and a half to our paradise at ——;
but we are not going to give you our
address, or we should be pestered to
death with your visits. Suffice it to
say that Figgins’s is a good specimen
of a citizen’s villa <em>near</em> London. Now,
there are several kinds of villas:
there is the villa near London, and
the villa not near: there is the villa
in a row, and the detached villa:
there is your lodge, and your park,
and your grange, and your cottage
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ornée</i>; and best of all, in our opinion,
there is—what is neither the one nor
the other of all these—there is the
plain old-fashioned country-house:—once
a cottage, then a farm, then a
gentleman’s house: irregular, odd,
picturesque, unpretending, comfortable,
and convenient. But Figgins’s
is a new slap-up kind of affair; built
within the last two years, and uniting
in itself all the last improvements
and the most recent elegancies. He
has settled himself in a neighbourhood
quite the genteelest of that genteel
district: for, though merchants and
men of yesterday, so to speak, the
people of Albert Terrace show that
they have respect for the good times
of yore, and they admire the character
of the fine old English gentleman:
they pride themselves, moreover, on
being a steady set of people, and they
show their respect for things ancient
even in the outward arrangements of
their dwellings. Thus you enter each
of the twenty little gardens surrounding
each of the twenty little detached
houses, through gates with Norman
pillars at their sides, that would have
done honour to Durham or Canterbury;
while the wooden barriers themselves
are none of your radical innovations
on the Greek style, nor any
of your old impious fox-hunting five-bars,
but beautiful pieces of fretwork,
copied from the stalls of Exeter
Cathedral, painted so nicely in oak,
and so well varnished, that Stump
the painter must have out-stumped
himself in their execution. Once
within the gate, however, and the
connecting wall—capped, we ought
to have said, with a delicious Elizabethan
cornice—all Gothic formality
ends for the while; and you are lost
in astonishment at the serpentine
meanderings, the flowing lines, and
the thousand attractions of the garden.
An ill-natured friend, who
went with us, took objection at the
weeping ash, in the middle of the circular
grass-plot in front of the door;
but he altered his mind in the evening,
when he found the chairs ranged
under its sociable branches—and the
Havannahs and sherry-coblers crowding
the little table made to fit round
the central stem. ’Twas a wrinkle
that which he was not up to:—he was
a Goth—a cockney. Figgins, though
a Londoner, knows what’s what, in
matters of that kind; and shows his
good taste in such a practical combination
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">utile</i> with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dulce</i>.
On either side of the house, the pathways
ran off with the most mysterious
windings among the rhododendrons
and lilac bushes, and promised a
glimpse of better things in the garden
behind, when we should have
passed through our host’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">atrium,
aula, porticus</i>, and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">viridarium</i>. Figgins’s
house has its main body, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">corps
de logis</i>, composed of two little bits
of wings, and a wee little retiring
centre—the former have their gables
capped with the most elaborate
“barge-boards,” as the architects
term them, all fretwork and filigree,
and swell out below into bay windows,
with battlements at top big enough
for Westminster Abbey. The centre
has a narrow and exceedingly Gothic
doorway, and one tiny bit of a window
over it, through which no respectably-sized
mortal has any chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
of getting his head: and again over
this is a goodly shield, large enough
to contain the blazoned arms of all
the Figginses. The builder has evidently
gone upon the plan of making
the most of his design in a small compass;
but he has committed the absurdity
first of allowing subsidiary
parts to become principals, and then
of making the ornaments more important
than the spaces: thus the
centre is squeezed to death like a nut
in a pair of crackers, and battlements,
boards, and shield “engross us whole,”
by the obtrusiveness of their size and
workmanship. Nevertheless, this façade,
such as it is, struck us as beating
Johnson’s house, in Paragon Place,
all to nothing: there was something
like the trace of an idea in it, there
was an aim, or a pretension, at something:
whereas the other is really
nothing at all, and its appearance
indicates absolute vacuity in the
central cerebral regions of its inventor.
Figgins has two good rooms
on the ground floor, a lobby and staircase
between them, to keep the peace
between their occupants, three good
bed-rooms on his first, and four very
small ones up amongst his gables:
add to which, that he boasts of what
he calls his future dressing-room, but
what his wife says is to be her boudoir—we
forget where—but somewhere
up the stairs. All this again is much
better than the Paragon Place plan—it
shows that men recover somewhat of
their natural good sense when they
get into country air.</p>

<p>Figgins has not got a great deal of
room in his villa, it is true; but he and
his nineteen neighbours are all suitably
lodged; and when they all go
up to the Bank every morning in the
same omnibus, can congratulate themselves
on emerging each from his own
undivided territory; or when they all
come down again in the afternoon,
each in a different vehicle—(you never
meet the same faces in the afternoon
that you do in the morning trip: we
know not why, but so it is, and the
fact should be signalized to the Statistical
Society)—they can each perambulate
their own eighth of an acre
with their hands under their coat-tails
in solemn dignity; or their wife, while
awaiting their arrival, and listening to
the beef-steaks giving an extra fiz,
wanders round and round again, or,

<p class="in0">If Figgins had but insisted on having
the back of his residence plastered and
painted to look more natural than
stone, the same as the front—or,
better still, if his ambition could have
contented itself with the plain unsophisticated
original brick, we should
say nothing against his taste—’tis
peculiar certainly, but he’s better off
than Johnson.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of Woodbine
Lane, some wretch of a builder is
going to cut off the view of the Albert
Terrace people all over the narrow
field, as far as the brick kilns, by
erecting a row of contiguous dwellings
some three or four storeys high, besides
garrets, and they are to be in
the last Attic style imported. One
word is enough for them: the man
who knowingly and voluntarily goes
out of town to live in a house in a
row, like those lines of things in the
Clapham Road or at Hammersmith,
deserves to be sent with his house to
“eternal smash;” he is an animal
below the range of æsthetics, and is
not worth remonstrating with.</p>

<p>One of these next days, when we
take our hebdomadal excursion, we
intend going to see old Lady de Courtain
at Lowlands Abbey, near ——;
you can get to it in about twenty
minutes by the Great Western. It
is no abbey in reality, you know;
there never was any Foundation on
the spot further than what Sam Curtain,
when he was an upholsterer in
Finsbury, and before he got knighted,
had laid down in the swampy meadow
which he purchased, and thus bequeathed
to his widow: but it’s all
the same; it looks like an abbey;—that
is to say, there are plenty of
turrets, and the windows have all
labels over their heads, and there are
two Gothic conservatories, and two
Gothic lodges at each of the two
Gothic gates; and there is a sham
ruin at the end of the “Lake:” and
if this is not as good as a real abbey,
we should like to know what is. Old
Lady de Courtain was perfectly justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
in Normanizing her name and her
house:—why should she not? she had
plenty of money: had she been a man,
she could have bought a seat for half
a dozen boroughs, and might even
have gone a step higher; but, as it
is, she has married her eldest daughter
to the eldest son of Sir Thomas
Humbug, a new Whig baronet; and
she calls her house as she pleases.
We applaud the old lady’s spirit; she
has two other daughters still on the
stocks, and she gives good dinners;
we shall certainly go and patronize
her. Comfort for comfort, we are not
quite sure but that we had rather
take up our quarters with John Bold,
Esq., at Hazel House, on the top of
the hill opposite. It is quite a different-looking
mansion, and yet the
rooms are laid out nearly on the same
plan: in the one all is Gothic, in the
other all is classic: one is be-fretted,
and be-pinnacled, and be-shafted, and
be-buttressed; but the other has a
good plain Tuscan portico, like St
Paul’s in Covent-Garden—plain windows
wide and high, at enormous
distances from each other—sober
chimney-pots, that look as if they
were really meant to be smoked, and
not a single gimcrack or fanciful
device any where about the building.
It’s only a brick house plastered, after
all; but it has a certain air of ease
and comfort and respectability about
it, that corresponds to a nicety with the
character of its worthy inmate. If
the door were wide enough, you
might turn a coach and pair in the
dining-room; there is a good, wide,
low-stepped staircase; you may come
down it four-a-breast, and four steps
at a time, if you like—and if it were
well behaved so to do, but it isn’t;
and your bedroom would make two
of Figgins’s drawing-rooms, lobby and
all. The house always looks to us as
if it would last longer than Lady de
Courtain’s; and so we think it will;
just as we doubt not but that honest
John Bold’s dirty acres will be all in
their proper places when Lady de C.’s
three per cents shall be down at forty-two
again, and her houses in the city
shall be left empty by their bankrupt
tenants. They live, too, in a very
different way, and in widely distinct
circles: at the Abbey you meet many
an ex-civic notoriety, and many a
rising hope of Lombard Street: it is
a perpetual succession of dinners,
dances, and picnics: at the House
you are sure to be introduced to some
sober-faced, top-booted, elderly gentleman
or other, and to one or two
rotund black-skirted individuals; and
you find a good horse at your service
every morning, or the keeper is ready
for you in proper time and season;
and sometimes the county member
calls in, or a quorum of neighbouring
magistrates sit there in solemn conclave.
One is the house of to-day,
the other of yesterday: one keeps up
the reminiscences of the town, and of
a peculiar part of the town, rather too
strongly; the other actually smells of
the country, and, though so near the
metropolis, has nothing with it in
common. Their owners, when they
go to town, live, one in the Regent
Park, the other in Park Lane.</p>

<p>Another acquaintance of ours—and
this we will say that we are proud of
being known to him—dwells in an
old-fashioned gloomy house at Petersham.
It is a respectable old gentleman
in a brown coat, black shorts,
white waistcoat, and a pigtail; and
is a member of the Royal Society as
well as of the Society of Antiquarians.
The house in question suits him, and
he suits the house; it was built in
the time of that impudent intriguing
Dutchman who came over here and
drove out his uncle and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">beau-père</i>;
and it accordingly possesses all the
heavy dignity of the Dutch houses of
that period. The windows are pedimented
and cased with mouldings; they
are lofty and sufficiently numerous;
the doorway has two cherubs flying,
with cabbages and roses round the
shell that hangs over it; and the
lawns are still cut square, and have
queer-shaped beds and parterres.
There is something dignified and
solemn in the very bricks of the
mansion, wearing as they do a more
regular and sombre hue of red than
the dusty-looking things of the present
day; and when you once get into the
spacious rooms, all floored and pannelled
with oak, you feel a glow of
veneration for olden times—though
not for <em>those</em> times—that you cannot
define, but which is nevertheless excessively
pleasing. While sitting in
the well-stored library of this mansion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
you expect to see Addison
walking in at the one door, and Swift
at another; and you are not quite
sure but that you may have to meet
Bolingbroke at dinner, and take a
glass of wine with Prior or Pope.
There are numberless large cupboards
all over the place; you could sit
inside any of the fireplaces, if the
modern grates were, as we wish them,
removed: and as for opening or
slamming a door in a hurry, it is not
to be done; they are too heavy; no
such impertinences can ever be
tolerated in such a residence. And
then our friend himself—we could tell
you such a deal about him, but we
are writing about houses, not men—you
must go and get introduced to
him yourself. Let it be put down in
your pocket memoranda, whenever
you hear of a house of this kind to
let, either take it yourself or recommend
somebody else whom you have
a regard for to do so. It is not a
handsome, stylish kind of house; but
it is one of the right sort to live in.</p>

<p>Very little is to be said in blame,
much in praise, of the majority of
English country gentlemen’s houses;
if atrocities of taste be committed
any where, it is principally near the
metropolis, where people are only
half-and-half rural, or rather are of
that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rus-in-urbe</i> kind, that is in its
essence thoroughly cockney. There
is every variety of mansion throughout
the land, every combination of
style, and more often the absence of
all style at all; and in most cases
the houses, at least the better kind
of them, are evidently made to suit
the purposes of the dweller rather
than the architect. This ought to be
the true rule of building for all dwellings,
except in the cases of those aristocratic
palaces or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">châteaux</i> where
the public character of the owner requires
a sacrifice of private convenience
to public dignity. Houses that are
constructed in accordance with the
requirements of those that are to live
in them, and that are suited to the
exigencies of their ground and situation,
are sure to please longer, and to
gratify the taste of a greater number
of persons, than those which are the
mere embodyings of an architect’s
portfolio. This, however, requires that
the principles of the architect should
be allowed to vary from the strict
proportions of the classic styles;—or
rather, that he should be allowed to
copy the styles of civil architecture,
whether of Greece or Rome, or of
ancient Europe. The fault hitherto
has been, that designers of houses have
taken all their ideas, models, and
measurements from the religious rather
than the civil buildings of antiquity;
and that they have thought the capitals
of the Jupiter Stator more suited to
an English gentleman’s residence than
the capricious yet elegant decorations
of a villa at Pompeii. In the same
way, until very lately, those who call
themselves “Gothic Architects” have
been putting into houses windows
from all the cathedrals and monasteries
of the country, but have seldom
thought of copying the more suitable
details of the many mansions and
castellated houses that still exist.
Better sense and better taste are now
beginning to prevail, and we observe
excellent houses rising around us.
Of these, by far the larger proportion
are in the styles of the Middle Ages;
and for this reason, that the architects
who practise in those styles have
a wider field to range in for their
models, and have also more thoroughly
emancipated themselves from their
former professional thraldom. There
is also a very decided reaction in the
public taste in favour of the arts of
the Middle Ages, or rather let us say,
in favour of a style of national architecture;—and
as the Greek and Roman
styles have little to connect them
with the historical associations of an
Englishman’s mind, they have fallen
into comparative disfavour. For one
purely classic house now erected, there
are three or four Gothic. The worst
of it is, however, that from the low
state into which architecture had fallen
by the beginning of the present century,
and even for some time afterwards,
there has been no sufficient
space and opportunity for creating a
number of good architects adequate
to meet the demands of the public;
and hence, the greatest barbarisms are
being daily perpetrated, even with the
best intentions of doing the correct
thing, both on the part of the man who
orders a building, and of him who builds.
Architecture is a science not to be acquired
in a day, nor by inspiration;—nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
will the existence of one eminent
man in that profession immediately
cause a hundred others of the same
stamp to rise up around him. On the
contrary, it requires a long course
of scientific study, and of actual
scientific practice; it demands that
a great quantity of traditionary precepts
be kept up, and handed down
from master to pupil through many
generations of students and practitioners:
it requires the accumulation
of an enormous number of good instances
and examples; and in most
cases it is to be polished by long foreign
travel. Now, all this cannot
be accomplished in an impromptu,
off-hand manner: the profession of
architecture requires to be raised and
kept up at a certain height of excellence
through many long years:
it is like the profession of medicine,
of law, or the study of all scientific
matters: when once the school of architecture
declines, the practice of it
declines in the same ratio, and the
resuscitation of it becomes a work of
considerable time. Such a regenerating
of architecture is going on amongst
us: comparatively more money is
now laid out on buildings than at any
preceding period for the last hundred
years: our architects are becoming
more scientific and more accomplished:
the profession is occupying a
higher rank than it has lately done;
and we may, therefore, hope for an
increasing proportion of satisfactory
results. If only the public eye be
cultivated and refined in a similar
degree, we may reasonably expect
that some beautiful and notable works
will be executed.</p>

<p>Not, however, to launch forth into
the wide question of architectural fitness
and beauty, we will confine our
observations to two special topics;
one concerning the ornamentation of
architectural objects, the other concerning
the materials used in private
dwellings.</p>

<p>Thank goodness for it! but people
are now beginning to see rather further
than six inches beyond their
noses, and to find out that if they
adopt ornament as the starting point,
and usefulness as the goal of their
architectural course, they are likely
to end in the committing of some
egregious folly. Private persons are
more convinced of this truth than
public ones; and the unprofessional
crowd more than professed architects.
In the one case, as ornament costs
dear, the pocket puts an effectual drag
on the vagaries of taste; whereas,
in the other, public money is most
commonly spent without any virtual
control: and again, all architects are
liable to descend to the prettinesses
of their profession rather than abide
by the great qualities of properly balanced
proportion and design. A bad
architect, too, is always seeking after
ornament to conceal his mistakes of
construction. In private houses,
therefore, the superabundance of bad
ornament that was adopted after a
period of its almost total disuse is now
giving way to a moderate employment
of it; but, in public buildings, the
rage for covering blank spaces, and
for getting rid of sharp edges or corners,
still continues. Persons who
have not inquired practically into the
matter can hardly believe how very
meagre is the stock of ornament with
which nine architects out of ten set
up in their trade; looking at what they
usually employ in the Greek or Roman
style, we observe that the details
are generally debased clumsy copies of
antiques, jumbled together with much
incongruity, and commonly altered
in proportions. We do not apply this
to capitals and bases, which are now
worked with tolerable precision, though
even in these we observe a heaviness
of hand and eye that detracts greatly
from their effect; we refer more particularly
to mouldings, and to the decoration
of cornices and friezes. Any
one who has visited the galleries of
the Vatican, or wandered over the
Acropolis of Athens, will recollect the
broad freedom and spirit with which
the most graceful details are treated,
and the total absence of stiffness or
heaviness in any of the designs;
whereas, whoever takes the trouble
of lounging about London must prepare
his eye for that overload of thick
heavy ornament which characterises
what is now called the English style.
The foliage of Greece and Italy was
well worked in those countries, because
the objects represented by the
architectural sculptor were familiar
to his own and to the public eye; his
own eye committed no blunder, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
would the public eye have tolerated
it. In the application, too, of the human
form to sculptured ornament, the
proportions and harmonies of the
body were too well known and felt
to allow of any egregious errors taking
place; hence, even in the decorating
a frieze, the wonderful taste and skill
of the Greek and Roman artists fully
appear; whereas, in the hands of the
English sculptor, such objects are
purely mythical—he knows them only
by imagination, not by reality, and
he properly designates them as “fancy
objects.” Hence their clumsiness,
their heaviness, and their incongruity.
In all the ordinary details of modern
common house-building, the mouldings
and enrichments ordinarily used
are of a very poor description; decorators
lived for a long time on the
slender stores of the puerile and meretricious
embellishments adopted from
the French, and translated, if we may
so say, for the use of the English
public;—they had lost the boldness
and originality which made the style
of Louis XIV. tolerable, or rather
agreeable; and they had substituted
in its place the poorest and the cheapest
kind of details that could be
worked. Let any one go and find
out a house in London, built between
1780 and 1810, and he will instantly
remark the meagreness of which we
are speaking. Grosvenor Square and
the adjacent streets abound with
houses of this kind; so does Portland
Place. Carlton House was one of the
most notable examples. In the stead
of this, after the war, came in a flood
of Greek ornament; every thing
Roman was thrown aside; all was to
be either Doric or Attic, with an occasional
admixture of the Egyptian:
the Greek zig-zag, the Greek honey-suckle
and acanthus, Doric flutings
and flat bands for cornices, swarmed
all over the land. Many an honest
builder must have broken his heart
on the occasion, for his old ornament-books
were no longer of use; and he
had, as it were, to learn his trade all
over again. From poor Batty Langley,
with his five orders of Gothic architecture,
who was the type of architects
towards the end of the last century,
down to Nash, Smirke, and Wilkins,
who had it all their own way at the
beginning of the present, such was
the commutation and revolution of
ornamental propriety. These styles
were not the only ones that had to go
through changes of accessory parts, and
to suffer from the caprices of those
that dressed them up for public exhibition:
the revivers of the mediæval
styles, the new and old Gothic
men, ran also their race of absurdity
and clumsy invention. It was long—very
long, before they could make
any approach towards a proper understanding
of the spirit of their predecessors:
all was to them a thorough
mystery: and it is actually only within
the last ten years that any tolerable
accuracy has been attained in such
matters. Norman capitals used to be
put on shafts of the 15th century, and
perpendicular corbels used in early
English buildings: as for the tracery
of windows, it was “confusion worse
confounded”—architects there ran
quite mad. In these classes of ornamental
forms, the faults of awkward
and ignorant imitators have been
equally apparent: for just as English
sculptors have made the Greek acanthus
and olive twine and enwreath
themselves like Dutch cabbages and
crab-trees, so the modern Gothics
have made their water-lilies, their
ivy, their thistle, and their oak-leaves
twist and frizzle in præternatural
stiffness—while their griffins and
heraldic monsters have ramped and
regarded and displayed in the most
awful and mysterious manner. Gothic
decorators, too, fell into the mistake
of over-ornamenting their objects
far more than the pseudo-classical
men did: what used to be called Gothic
ornament in 1820—no longer ago
than that—is now so intolerable that
many an expensive building requires
to be re-erected ere it can square with
the laws of common sense and good
taste. Gothic furniture-makers went
wild in their peculiar art; and there
are still numberless magnificent drawing-rooms
that require to be entirely
unfurnished ere their owners can lay
claim to any portion of decorative
discernment. Eton Hall and Fonthill
(while the latter stood) were two
notable instances of this lamentable
excess of Gothic absurdity. Windsor
Castle is by no means free from blame;
and in fact there is hardly a Gothic
house in England, of modern date,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
that does not require the severe hand
of the architectural reformer.</p>

<p>To hit the due medium in such
matters is not easy; and the reason is,
that in architecture we are all imitators,
not originators: we are all
aiming at renovating old things and
restoring old buildings, rather than at
inventing new ones: and the result
is, that architectural genius and invention
are thereby closely cramped and
thwarted. To imitate all the details
of an old style in the closest manner
is indispensable when ancient buildings
are to be restored, or when an
exact facsimile is to be produced in
some new work: but for the ornamental
powers of the architect to be perpetually
tied down to one set class of
forms, is to lower him to the level of
a Chinese artist.</p>

<p>Unless we are mistaken, it appears
to us that the Greeks imitated nature
in her most perfect and abstract forms
of beauty: and that they, with their
successors the Romans, or rather the
later Greeks, sought for beautiful objects
as adapted to architectural ornament,
wherever they could find them.
They were not prevented by any traditional
or conventional proprieties
from imitating and using the beautiful
and the natural wherever they might
exist: all the varied forms of nature
would have come right to them had
they been willing. They seem, however,
not to have taken so wide a
range as we should have expected;
or else their works that have come
down to us are so few in number that
their choice seems to have been rather
restricted. The Middle Age architects
also took a wide or rather a free range
in the forms of the vegetable and animal
world: but they worked with barbarous
eyes and stiff hands; nor till
the twelfth century do they seem to
have arrived at that artistical freedom
and correctness which are requisite
to interpret and to imitate the multiplex
forms of the natural world. As
for the human figure, they confined
themselves principally to draperied
forms; and they embued these with
considerable elegance; nevertheless,
through all their operations, we trace
a want of anatomical knowledge,
which not all their ready invention
can conceal, and which is scarcely
compensated by the value of their
sculpture, as a contemporaneous illustration
of mediæval history. Heraldry
seems always to have been a
mystic and a mythic art; and hence
heraldic forms have a certain privilege
of caricature and distortion from which
it is in vain to try to emancipate them.</p>

<p>Such being the case, it becomes a
question—how should modern ornament
be composed? In the classic style,
are we always to adhere to foreign
foliage, foreign animals, and mythological
figures: and in the Gothic
style, are we always to preserve the
same rigidity and distortion which
prevailed as long as those styles were
in actual practice? We apprehend
the true rule of æsthetics in this
case to be, as we implied before,
that for restorations or exact facsimiles
of buildings, whether classical
or mediæval, the very form as
well as the spirit of the ornaments
contemporaneously used in such buildings
should be most strictly adopted.
An imitation, unless it is an exact
one, is good for nothing, as far as
architecture is concerned. But should
we prevail on ourselves either to depart
from these styles, or to carry out
their main principles, so as to form a
national style of our own—not a fixed
one, but a style varying through different
ages, suiting itself to the social
requirements of each—then we should
be prepared, not only to call in the
aid of natural beauty to the fullest
extent, but also to avail ourselves of
all that rich fund of form which results
from the extensive use of scientific
knowledge, and the investigation
of physical curves. There is no reason
why such a style, or succession of
styles, should not be formed, if the
great principles of science and utility
be taken as the substructure on which
imagination may afterwards raise its
enrichment: and, if ever it come into
existence, we have the unlimited
expanse of the universe to range
through in search of beauty and harmony.
It is impossible to say what
changes the introduction of new mathematical
forms may not produce,
and produce with good effect: thus
the beautiful curve of the catena
would not have been known, but for
the introduction of suspension bridges.
The application of the cycloid is comparatively
modern, though the curve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
itself is ancient; and the grand effect
of the horizontal line was not fully
known—despite of Greece and Rome—till
our interminable lines of railroad
had stretched their lengths across the
land. In the same way, our more
extended and more intimate knowledge
of the animal and vegetable
kingdom ought to furnish us with an
immense variety of new and beautiful
forms of ornament—we do not mean
of mythic or fanciful ornament, but of
that highest and best kind of decoration,
absolute, and yet partial, imitation
of nature. Thus, for example, have we
a blank space, extending horizontally
to a long distance, which we desire to
cover with enrichments. We have
our choice, either in mathematical
forms and combination of forms, such
as mediæval architects might have
applied, or else we may throw along
it wreaths and branches of foliage,
peopled with insect life, or enlivened
by birds and animals. A succession
of simple oak-branches or laurel-leaves,
or the shoots of any other
common plants, faithfully imitated,
and cut into mimic life, from the inanimate
stone, would form an ornament
of the most effective kind, and
would constitute a work of art, being
an intelligent and poetical interpretation
of natural beauty. In the building
of our houses, why should the
straight line and sections of the circle
be the only lines admissible for doors,
windows, and roofs? Why should
the Greek and Roman ovolo, cavetto,
and square, be the only combination
that we know of in our common mouldings?
How much richer were the
architects of the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries, who drew with
“free hands,” and gave us such exquisite
effects of light and shade! We
are firmly persuaded, that an architect,
deeply imbued with the scientific
principles of his profession, and endowed,
at the same time, with the
hand and the eye of a skilful artist,
may cause a most happy and useful
reformation of our national architecture.</p>

<p>In our choice of materials for our
common buildings, it appears that we
are always struggling with a deficiency
of pecuniary means: for we
never yet met an architect whose
skill was not thwarted, in this respect,
by the necessities of his employer.
Such a man would have built
a splendid palace, only he was not
allowed to use stone; another would
have made a magnificent hall, had he
been able to employ oak instead of
deal. Whenever people are so situated
that they are restricted in their
choice of materials, they should remember
that they are immediately
limited, both in construction and
in decorative forms; and, being so
limited, it becomes an absurdity in
them to aim at any thing that is unreal,
any thing that is in fact beyond
their means. This has been
one of the curses of all architectural
and ornamental art in modern
times, that every thing has been imitative,
fictitious, sham, make-believe:—brick
is stuccoed to look like
stone, and fir is painted to look like
oak. It is impossible for art to
flourish when an imitative object can
be accepted in the place of original
ones; for when once public taste becomes
so much vitiated as to be easily
satisfied with cheap copies of the real
instead of the real itself, the productive
faculties of the artist and the
manufacturer take a wrong turn, and
go directly to increase rather than diminish
the evil. On architecture, the
effects of a corrupted national desire
for the cheap and the easily made are
peculiarly disastrous: this being the
least suited of all arts to any thing
like deception, since, to be good, it
must be essentially real and true.
Hence it has arisen, that instead of
being content with humble brick, and
learning how to convert that material
to purposes of ornamentation, the use
of stucco and cement has become universal—materials
totally unsuited to
our country and climate. The decorative
portion of architecture has fallen
into the same track, and elaborate
looking things in plaster, and fifty
other substances—in the production
of which art has had no share—have
come to cover our ceilings and our
walls. Had not, indeed, the repairs
and erection of public buildings called
forth the dormant skill of our workmen,
decorative art had long since
become extinct amongst us. It may
therefore be taken as a fundamental
rule in architecture, that the decorations
of buildings should be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
either of the same materials as the
edifices themselves, or that more costly
substances should be combined
with the former, and should serve for
the decorator to exercise his skill on.
Thus the combination of stone with
brick, an old-fashioned expedient, is
good, because it is justified by all the
exigencies of constructive skill, and
because it is founded on common
sense. Look for what effective buildings
may be thus produced at Lincoln’s
Inn, the Temple, St James’s,
and several of our colleges in the universities:
how intrinsically superior
are these to the flimsy shabby buildings
of Regent Street and its
Park: even old Buckingham House
was good in comparison with some
of these. Or go to Hampton Court
and Kensington, and see how much
grandeur may be produced by proportions
and well-combined decoration,
without any cement, stucco, or
paint, to bedizen the walls. If a man
cannot be content to adopt plain brick
with such instances as these before
his eyes, let him travel forth a little,
and see what the effect of the great
brick buildings is in Holland, or the
south-west of France, where the most
admirable churches and public edifices
are all erected of this material.
Sculptured ornament is of course out
of the question in such a case as this:
nothing but stone will bear the chisel
and mallet to produce any effect that
shall satisfy the eye and the judgment
of the lover of natural beauty.</p>

<p>We protest strongly against all
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">terra-cotta</i> imitations of sculptural
forms; but for geometrical figure
they are allowable, and their stiffness,
if justified by sufficient solidity,
will be found highly suitable for buildings
of such a kind.</p>

<p>Whenever the means of the employer
are ample enough, let him
make up his mind to sink a little
additional capital, and build a good
stone house, that shall last him and
his family for a couple of centuries,
instead of a rickety edifice, that can
endure for only a couple of generations.
And, in this case, let him
call in the decorative aid of the architect,
to whatever amount his taste
dictates. Ornament, to be effective,
need not be abundant; it should be
employed sparingly rather than the
contrary; and, if kept in its proper
place, and limited to its due purposes,
it will reward its owner’s eye, and will
prove a permanent source of artificial
satisfaction. Good stone-work without,
and good oak-work within, will
make a house that a prince may live
in. A good house, well built and
well decorated, is like a good coat—there
is some pleasure in wearing it;
it will last long, and look well the
whole time; it will bear reparation;
and (though we cannot say the same
of any short-cut, upper Benjamin, or
jacket we ever wore—we wish we
could) it will always fetch the price
given for it. We have plenty of the
finest stone and timber within this
snug little island of ours, and it is
entirely our own fault that we are
not one of the best-built people in
the universe.</p>

<h2 id="YEOMAN">HOW I BECAME A YEOMAN.</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h3>

<p>Had the royal army of Israel been
accoutred after the colour and fashion
of the British battalions, I am quite
satisfied that another enigma would
have been added by King Solomon to
his special list of incomprehensibilities.
The extraordinary fascination which
a red coat exercises over the minds
and optics of the fair sex, appears to
me a greater phenomenon than any
which has been noticed by Goethe in
his Theory of the Development of
Colours. The same fragment of ensanguined
cloth will irritate a bull,
charm a viper, and bewitch the heart
of a woman. No civilian, however
good-looking or clean-limbed—and I
rather pique myself upon my pins—has
the ghost of a chance when opposed
in the lists of love to an officer,
a mail-guard, a whipper-in, or a postman.
You may be as clever a fellow
as ever coopered up an article for the
Magazine, as great a poet as Byron,
in beauty an Antinous, in wit a Selwyn,
in oratory a Canning—you may
dance like Vestris, draw like Grant,
ride like Alexander; and yet, with all
these accomplishments, it is a hundred
chances to one that your black
coat, although fashioned by the shears
and polished by the goose of Stultz,
will be extinguished by the gaudy
scarlet habiliments of a raw-boned
ensign, emancipated six months ago,
for the first time in his life, from the
wilderness of a Highland glen, and
even now as awkward a cub as ever
presumed to plunge into the perils of
a polka.</p>

<p>Let no man, nor woman either,
consider these observations flummery
or verbiage. They are my calm deliberate
opinions, written, it is true,
under circumstances of considerable
irritation, but nevertheless deliberate.
I have no love to the army, for I have
been sacrificed for a dragoon. My
affections have been slighted, my person
vilified, my professional prospects
damaged, and my constitution fearfully
shaken in consequence of this military
mania. I have made an idiot of myself
in the eyes of my friends and relatives.
I have absolutely gone upon
the turf. I have lost some valuable
inches of epidermis, and every bone
of my body feels at the present
moment as sore as though I were the
sole survivor of a terrific railway
collision. A more injured individual
than myself never mounted upon a
three-legged stool, and from that high
altitude I now hurl down defiance
and anathemas upon the regulars, be
they horse or foot, sappers or miners,
artillery, pioneers, or marines!</p>

<p>It was my accursed fate to love,
and love in vain. I do not know
whether it was the eye or the instep,
the form or the voice, of Edith Bogle,
which first drew my attention, and
finally fascinated my regards, as I
beheld her swimming swan-like down
the Assembly Rooms at the last
Waverley Ball. A more beautiful
representative of Die Vernon could
not have been found within the
boundary of the three kingdoms. Her
rich auburn hair flowed out from beneath
the crimson network which
strove in vain to confine within its
folds that bright luxuriant sea—on
her brow there lay one pearl, pure as
an angels tear—and oh! sweet even
to bewilderment was the smile that
she cast around her, as, resting upon
the arm of the moody Master of
Ravenswood, she floated away—a
thing of light—in the mazy current
of the waltz! I shall not dwell now
upon the circumstances of the subsequent
introduction; on the delicious
hour of converse at the supper-table;
or on the whispered, and—as I flattered
myself—conscious adieux, when,
with palpitating heart, I veiled her
fair shoulders with the shawl, and felt
the soft pressure of her fingers as I
tenderly assisted her to her chair. I
went home that night a lovesick
Writer to the Signet. One fairy form
was the sole subject of my dreams,
and next morning I woke to the conviction,
that without Edith Bogle earth
would be a wilderness, and even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
bowers of Paradise damp, chilly, and
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>There is no comfort in looking back
upon a period when hope was high
and unchecked. I have met with
men who, in their maudlin moments—usually
towards the close of the
evening—were actuated by an impulse
similar to that which compelled
the Ancient Mariner to renew his
wondrous tale: and I have heard
them on such occasions recount the
whole circumstances of their unfortunate
wooing with voices choked by
grief, and with tears of tender imbecility.
I have observed, however,
that, on the morrow succeeding such
disclosures, these gentlemen have invariably
a shy and sheepish appearance,
as though inwardly conscious
that they had extended their confidence
too far, and rather dubious as
to the sincerity of their apparent
sympathizers. Warned by their example,
I hold it neither profitable nor
wise to push my own confessions too
far. If Edith gave me at the outset
more encouragement than she ought
to have done—if she systematically
led me to believe that I had made an
impression upon her heart—if she
honoured me with a preference so
marked, that it deceived not only
myself, but others—let the blame be
hers. But why should I go minutely
into the courtship of half a year?
As difficult, indeed, and as futile,
would it be to describe the alternations
of an April day, made up of sunshine
and of shower, of cloud and rainbow
and storm—sometimes mild and hopeful,
then ominous of an eve of tempest.
For a long time, I had not the
slightest suspicion that I had a rival.
I remarked, indeed, with somewhat of
dissatisfaction, that Edith appeared
to listen too complacently to the
commonplace flatteries of the officers
who are the habitual haunters of
private ball and of public assembly.
She danced too often with Ensign
Corkingham, flirted rather openly
with Major Chawser, and certainly
had no business whatever to be present
at a military fête and champagne
luncheon given at the Castle
by these brave defenders of their
country. I was not invited to that
fête, and the circumstance, as I well
remember, was the cause of a week’s
coolness between us. But it was not
until Lieutenant Roper of the dragoons
appeared in the field that I
felt any particular cause for uneasiness.</p>

<p>To give the devil his due, Roper
was a handsome fellow. He stood
upwards of six feet in his boots, had
a splendid head of curling black hair,
and a mustachio and whiskers to
match. His nose was beautifully
aquiline, his eyes of the darkest hazel,
and a perpetual smile, which the puppy
had cultivated from infancy, disclosed
a box of brilliant dominoes. I knew
Roper well, for I had twice bailed him
out of the police-office, and, in return,
he invited me to mess. Our obligations,
therefore, to each other might be
considered as nearly equal—in fact,
the balance, if any, lay upon his side,
as upon one occasion he had won from
me rather more than fifty pounds at
ecarté. He was not a bad fellow
either, though a little slap-dash in his
manner, and somewhat supercilious in
his cups; on which occasions—and
they were not unfrequent—he was by
far too general in his denunciation of
all classes of civilians. He was, I
believe, the younger son of a Staffordshire
baronet, of good connexions,
but no money—in fact, his patrimony
was his commission, and he was notoriously
on the outlook for an heiress.
Now, Edith Bogle was rumoured
to have twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Judge then of my disgust, when, on
my return on a rent-gathering expedition
to Argyleshire, I found Lieutenant
Roper absolutely domiciled
with the Bogles. I could not call
there of a forenoon on my way from
the Parliament-House, without finding
the confounded dragoon seated on
the sofa beside Edith, gabbling away
with infinite fluency about the last
ball, or the next review, or worsted-work,
or some similar abomination.
I question whether he had ever read
a single book since he was at school,
and yet there he sat, misquoting
Byron to Edith—who was rather of a
romantic turn—at no allowance, and
making wild work with passages out
of Tom Moore’s Loves of the Angels.
How the deuce he got hold of them,
I am unable up to this day to fathom.
I suspect he had somehow or other
possessed himself of a copy of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
“Beauties,” and dedicated an hour
each morning to committing extracts
to memory. Certainly he never
opened his mouth without enunciating
some rubbish about bulbuls, gazelles,
and chibouques; he designated
Edith his Phingari, and swore roundly
by the Koran and Kiebaubs. It
was to me perfectly inconceivable how
any woman of common intellect could
listen to such egregious nonsense, and
yet I could not disguise from myself
the consciousness of the fact, that
Miss Bogle rather liked it than otherwise.</p>

<p>Roper had another prodigious advantage
over me. Edith was fond of
riding, an exercise to which, from my
earliest years, I have had the utmost
abhorrence. I am not, I believe, constitutionally
timid, and yet I do not
know almost any ordeal which I would
not cheerfully undergo, to save me
from the necessity of passing along a
stable behind the heels of half a dozen
stationary horses. Who knows at
what moment the concealed demon
may be awaked within them? They
are always either neighing, or pulling
at their halters, or stamping, or
whisking their tails, in a manner
which is absolutely frightful; and it
is impossible to predict the exact moment
they may select for lashing out,
and, it may be, scattering your brains
by the force of a hoof most murderously
shod with half a hundred-weight
of iron. The descent of Hercules to
Hades seems to me a feat of mere insignificance
compared with the cleaning
out of the Augean stables, if, as I
presume, the inmates were not previously
removed.</p>

<p>Roper, on the contrary, rode like a
Centaur, or the late Ducrow. He
had several brutes, on one or other of
which you might see him every afternoon
prancing along Princes Street,
and he very shortly contrived to make
himself the constant companion of
Edith in his daily rides. What took
place on these occasions, of course I do
not know. It was, however, quite
clear to me, that the sooner this sort
of thing was put an end to the better;
nor should I have cared one farthing
had a civil war broke out, if that event
could have ensured to me the everlasting
absence of the pert and pestilential
dragoon.</p>

<p>In this dilemma I resolved to make
a confidante of my cousin Mary Muggerland.
Mary and I were the best
possible friends, having flirted together
for five successive seasons, with intermissions,
on a sort of general understanding
that nothing serious was
meant, and that either party was at
liberty at any time to cry off in case
of an extraneous attachment. She
listened to the history of my sorrows
with infinite complacency.</p>

<p>“I am afraid, George,” she said,
“that you have no chance whatever:
I know Edith well, and have heard
her say, twenty times over, that she
never will marry any man unless he
belongs to the army.”</p>

<p>“Then I have been exceedingly
ill-used!”</p>

<p>“O fie, George—I wonder at you!
Do you think that nobody besides
yourself has a right to change their
mind? How often, I should like to
know, have you varied your attachments
during the last three years?”</p>

<p>“That is a very different matter,
Mary.”</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to
explain the difference?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! is there no distinction
between a mere passing flirtation and
a deep-rooted passion like mine?”</p>

<p>“I understand—this is the first
time there has been a rival in the
case. Well—I am sorry I cannot
help you. Rely upon it that Roper
is the man; and, to be plain with
you, I am not at all surprised at
it.”</p>

<p>“Mary!—what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Do you really know so little of
the sex as to flatter yourself that a
lively girl like Edith, with more imagination
than wit, would prefer you,
who—pardon me, dear cousin—are
rather a commonplace sort of personage,
to a gay young officer of dragoons?
Why, don’t you see that he
talks more to her in one hour than
you do in four-and-twenty? Are not
his manners more fascinating—his attentions
more pointed—his <span class="locked">looks”——</span></p>

<p>“Upon my word, Miss Mary!”
I exclaimed, “this <em>is</em> going rather
too far. Do you mean to say that in
point of personal <span class="locked">appearance”——</span></p>

<p>“I do, indeed, George. You know
I promised you to be candid.”</p>

<p>“Say no more. I see that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
women are all alike. These confounded
scarlet <span class="locked">coats”——</span></p>

<p>“Are remarkably becoming; and
really I am not sure that in one of
them—if it were particularly well
made—you might not look almost as
well as Roper.”</p>

<p>“I have half a mind to turn postman!”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea for a man of letters.
But why don’t you hunt?”</p>

<p>“I dislike riding.”</p>

<p>“You stupid creature! Edith never
will marry you: so you may just as
well abandon the idea at once.”</p>

<p>So ended my conference with my
cousin. I had made it a rule, however,
never to believe above one half
of what Miss Mary Muggerland said;
and, upon the whole, I am inclined to
think that was a most liberal allowance
of credulity. A young lady is
not always the safest depository of
such secrets, or the wisest and most
sound adviser. A little spice of spite
is usually intermingled with her counsels;
and I doubt whether in one case
out of ten they sincerely wish success
to their simple and confiding clients.
On one point, however, I was inclined
to think her right. Edith certainly
had a decided military bias.</p>

<p>I begin to think that there is more
in judicial astrology than most people
are inclined to admit. To what other
mysterious fount than the stars can
we trace that extraordinary principle
which regulates men in the choice of
their different professions? Take half
a dozen lads of the same standing and
calibre; give them the same education;
inculcate them with the same doctrines;
teach them the identical catechism;
and yet you will find that in
this matter of profession there is not
the slightest cohesion among them.
Had I been born under the influence
of Mars, I too might have been a dragoon—as
it was, Saturn, my planetary
godfather, had devoted me to the
law, and here I stood a discomfited
concocter of processes, and a botcher
of deeds and titles. Pondering these
things deeply, I made my way to the
Parliament-House, then in the full
hum attendant upon the close of the
Session. The usual groups of the
briefless were gathered around the
stoves. As I happened to have a
paper in my hand, I was instantly
assailed by half a dozen.</p>

<p>“Hallo, M’Whirter, my fine fellow—d’ye
want a counsel? Set you
down cheap at a condescendence,”
cried Mr Anthony Whaup, a tall barrister
of considerable facetiousness.</p>

<p>“I say, M’Whirter, is it a <em>semiplena</em>?
Hand it over to Randolph;
he has lots of experience in that line.”</p>

<p>“Get out, you heretical humbug!
Never mind these fellows, George.
Tip, and I’m your man,” said Randolph.</p>

<p>“Can any body tell me who is
pleading before the Second Division
just now?” asked a youth, looking
rather white in the gills.</p>

<p>“Old Windlass. He’s good for
three quarters of an hour at least, and
then the judges have to give their
opinions.”</p>

<p>“I’m devilish glad to hear it. I
think I shall bolt.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you got that case over
yet, Prior?”</p>

<p>“No, nor sha’n’t for a week. A
confounded count and reckoning, with
columns of figures as long as Anthony.
Well, Scripio, how are stocks?”</p>

<p>“Rather shakey. What do you
say to a shot at the Northerns?”</p>

<p>“O, hang Northerns! I burned
my fingers with them a month ago,”
replied Randolph. “This seems a fine
afternoon. Who’s for Musselburgh?”</p>

<p>“I can’t go to-day,” said Whaup.
“I was tempted yesterday with a
shilling, and sold myself.”</p>

<p>“Who is the unfortunate purchaser?”</p>

<p>“Tom Hargate, crimp-general to
the yeomanry.”</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to hear it, old fellow!
We have been wanting you
for two years back in the corps.
’Gad! won’t we have fun when we
go into quarters. I say, M’Whirter—why
don’t you become a yeoman?”</p>

<p>I started at the suggestion, which,
strange to say, had never crossed my
mind before. There <em>was</em> a way then
open to me—a method left by which
I might satisfy, without compromising
my professional character, the
scruples of Edith, and become a member
of the military service without
abandoning the pen. The man that
hesitates is lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
“I don’t know,” I replied. “I
think I should rather like it. It seems
a pretty uniform.”</p>

<p>“Pretty!” said Randolph. “By
the Lord Harry, it’s the splashest
affair possible! I’ll tell you what,
M’Whirter, I’ll back you in the yeoman’s
jacket and pantaloons against
the Apollo Belvidere.”</p>

<p>“It is regular Queen’s service,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it is. Only we have no
flogging.”</p>

<p>“That’s no great disadvantage.
Well, upon my word, I have a great
<span class="locked">mind”——</span></p>

<p>“Then, by Jove, there goes the
very man! Hallo—Hargate, I say—Tom
Hargate!”</p>

<p>“What’s the row?”</p>

<p>“Here’s a new recruit for you.
George M’Whirter, W.S. Book him
down, and credit me with the bounty
money.”</p>

<p>“The Edinburgh squadron, of
course,” said Hargate, presenting me
with a shilling.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry,” said one of
my friends. “There are better lancers
than the Templars. The Dalmahoy
die, but they never surrender!”</p>

<p>“Barnton <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la rescousse!</i>” cried
another.</p>

<p>“No douking in the Dalkeith!”
observed a third.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, boys! you are confounding
him. M’Whirter and Anthony
Whaup shall charge side by
side, and woe betide the insurgent
who crosses their path!” said Randolph.
“So the sooner you look after
your equipments the better.”</p>

<p>In this identical manner was I
nailed for the yeomanry.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>I confess that a thrill of considerable
exultation pervaded my frame,
as I beheld one morning on my dressing-table
a parcel which conscience
whispered to me contained the masterpiece
of Buckmaster. With palpitating
hand I cut the cord, undid the
brown paper foldings, and feasted my
eyes in a trance of ecstasy upon the
pantaloons, all gorgeous with the red
stripe; upon the jacket glittering with
its galaxy of buttons, and the polished
glory of the shoulder scales. Not
hurriedly, but with a protracted sense
of keen enjoyment, I cased myself in
the military shell, slung on the pouch-belt,
buckled the sabre, and finally adjusted
the magnificent helmet on my
brows. I looked into the mirror, and
hardly could recognise the counterpart
of Mars which confronted me.</p>

<p>“’Ods scimiters!” cried I, unsheathing
my Bilboa, and dealing,
with a reckless disregard to expense,
a terrific cut at the bed-post—“Let
me catch any fellow saying that the
yeomanry are not a constitutional
force!”</p>

<p>And so I strode into the breakfast-room,
where my old housekeeper was
adjusting the materials for the matutinal
meal.</p>

<p>“Lord save us a’!” cried Nelly,
dropping in her astonishment a platter
of finnans upon the floor—“Lord
save us a’, and keep us frae the sin
o’ bluidshed! Dear-a-me, Maister
George, can that really be you! Hae
ye turned offisher, and are ye gaun
oot to fecht!”</p>

<p>“To be sure, Nelly. I have joined
the yeomanry, and we shall turn out
next week. How do you like the
uniform?”</p>

<p>“Dinna speak to me o’ unicorns!
I’m auld enough to mind the days o’
that bluidy murderin’ villain Bony-party,
wha was loot loose upon huz,
as a scourge and a tribulation for the
backslidings o’ a sinfu’ land: and,
wae’s me! mony a mither that parted
frae her son, maybe as bonny, or a
hantle bonnier than yoursel’, had
sair een, and a broken heart, when
she heard that her laddie was streekit
cauld and stiff on the weary field o’
Waterloo! Na—for gudeness sake,
dinna draw yer swurd or I’ll swarff!
O, pit it aff—pit it aff, Maister George—There’s
a dear bairn, bide at hame,
and dinna gang ye a sodgerin’! Think
o’ the mither that lo’es ye, forbye
yer twa aunties. Wad ye bring doun
their hairs—I canna ca’ them a’ grey,
for Miss Kirsty’s is as red as a lobster—in
sorrow to the grave?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
“Why, you old fool, what are you
thinking of? We are not going out to
fight—merely for exercise.”</p>

<p>“Waur and waur! Can ye no tak’
yir yexerceese at hame, or doun at
the Links wi’ golf’ or gang awa’ to
the fishin’? Wadna that be better
than stravagin’ through the streets,
wi’ a lang swurd harlin’ ahint ye,
and consortin’ wi’ deboshed dragoons,
and drinkin’ the haill nicht, and rinnin’
wud after the lasses? And if
ye’re no gaun out to fecht, what’s the
use o’ye? Are ye gaun to turn anither
Claverse, and burn and hang puir
folk like the wicked and bluid-thirsty
troopers lang syne? Yexerceese indeed!
I wonder, Maister George,
ye’re no just ashamed o’ yersel!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, you old fool,
and bring the tea-pot.”</p>

<p>“Fule! ’Deed I’m maybe just an
auld fule to gang on clattering that
gate, for I never kent ye tak’ gude
advice syne ye were a wean. Aweel!
He that will to Cupar maun to Cupar.
Ye’se hae it a’ yer ain way; but maybe
we’ll see some day sune, when ye’re
carried hame on a shutter wi’ a broken
leg, or a stab in the wame, or bullet
in the harns, whilk o’ us twa is the
greater fule!”</p>

<p>“Confound that woman!” thought
I, as I pensively buttered my roll.
“What with her Cameronian nonsense
and her prophecies, she is enough
to disband a regiment.”</p>

<p>And, to say the truth, her last hint
about a broken leg was not altogether
foreign to my own apprehensions. I
had recollected of late, with no slight
uneasiness, that for this sort of service
a horse was quite as indispensable as
a man; and, as already hinted, I had
more than doubts as to my own equestrian
capabilities. However, I comforted
myself with the reflection, that
out of the fifty or sixty yeomen whom
I knew, not one had ever sustained
any serious injury; and I resolved,
as a further precaution against accident,
to purvey me the very quietest
horse that could be found any where.
Steadiness, I have always understood,
is the characteristic feature of the
British cavalry.</p>

<p>My correspondence that morning
was not of the legal kind. In the
first place, I received a circular from
the commanding-officer, extremely
laudatory of the recruits, whose zeal
for the service did them so much
credit. We were called upon, in an
animated address, to maintain the
high character of the regiment—to
prove ourselves worthy successors of
those who had ridden and fought before
us—to turn out regularly and
punctually to the field, and to keep
our accoutrements in order. Next
came a more laconic and pithy epistle
from the adjutant, announcing the
hours of drill, and the different arrangements
for the week; and finally,
a communication from the convener
of the mess committee.</p>

<p>To all these I cordially assented,
and having nothing better to do, bethought
me of a visit to the Bogles.
I pictured to myself the surprise of
Edith on beholding me in my novel
character.</p>

<p>“She shall see,” thought I, “that
years of dissipation in a barrack or
guard-room, are not necessary to qualify
a high-minded legal practitioner
for assuming his place in the ranks of
the defenders of his country. She
shall own that native valour is an impulse,
not a science. She shall confess
that the volunteer who becomes
a soldier, simply because the commonwealth
requires it, is actuated by
higher motive than the regular, with
his prospects of pay and of promotion.
What was Karl Theodore Körner,
author of the Lyre and Sword, but a
simple Saxon yeoman? and yet is there
any name, Blucher’s not excepted,
which stirs the military heart of Germany
more thrillingly than his? And,
upon my honour, even as a matter of
taste, I infinitely prefer this blue uniform
to the more dashing scarlet. It
is true they might have given us tails
to the jacket,” continued I soliloquizing,
as a young vagabond who
passed, hazarded a contumelious remark
regarding the symmetry of my
nether person. “But, on the whole,
it is a manly and a simple garb, and
Edith cannot be such a fool as not to
appreciate the motives which have
led me to assume it.”</p>

<p>So saying, I rung the Bogles’ bell.
Edith was in the drawing-room, and
there also, to my no small mortification,
was Lieutenant Roper. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
were sitting together on the sofa, and
I rather thought Miss Bogle started
as I came in.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! Mr M’Whirter,”
cried she with a giggle—Edith
never looked well when she giggled!—“What
<em>have</em> you been doing with
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I am not aware, Miss Bogle, that
there is any thing very <span class="locked">extraordinary”——</span></p>

<p>“O dear, no! I beg your pardon
for laughing, but really you look so
funny! I have been so used, you
know, to see you in a black coat, that
the contrast is rather odd. Pray forgive
my ignorance, Mr M’Whirter,
but what <em>is</em> that dress?”</p>

<p>“The uniform of the Mid-Lothian
Yeomanry Cavalry, madam. We are
going into quarters next week.”</p>

<p>“How very nice! Do you know
it is one of the prettiest jackets I ever
saw? Don’t you think so, Mr Roper?”</p>

<p>“Veway much so,” replied Roper,
reconnoitring me calmly through his
eyeglass. “A veway handsome
turn-out indeed. ’Pon my honour, I
had no idea they got up things so
cleverly in the <span class="locked">fencibles”——</span></p>

<p>“Yeomanry, if you please, Lieutenant
Roper!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! Yeomanry—so it is. I
say, M’Whirter, ’pon my soul, do you
know, you look quite killing! Do,
like a good fellow, just march to the
corner of the room, and let us have a
look at you on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Oh do, Mr M’Whirter!” supplicated,
or rather supplemented Edith.</p>

<p>I felt as if I could have shot him.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse me, Roper, for not
going through drill just now. If you
like to come to the review, you shall
see how our regiment can behave.
At any rate, we shall be happy to see
you at mess.”</p>

<p>“Oh certainly, certainly! Veway
good things those yeomanry messes.
Always a deal of claret, I believe.”</p>

<p>“And pray, Mr M’Whirter, what
rank do you hold in that distinguished
corps?” asked Miss Bogle.</p>

<p>“A full private, madam.”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!—then you’re
not even an officer!”</p>

<p>“A private of the yeomanry, Miss
Bogle, is, let me inform you, totally
independent of rank. We enrol ourselves
for patriotism, not for pay.
We are as honourable a body as the
Archers of the Scots Guard, the Cavaliers
of Dundee, or the <span class="locked">Mousquetaires”——</span></p>

<p>“How romantic and nice! I declare,
you are quite a D’Artagnan!”
said Edith, who had just read the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Trois Mousquetaires</i>.</p>

<p>“Don’t they pay you?” said
Roper. “’Pon my honour that’s
too bad. If I were you I’d memorialize
the Horse Guards. By the
way, M’Whirter, what sort of a
charger have you got?”</p>

<p>“Why, to say the truth,” replied
I, hesitatingly, “I am not furnished
with a horse as yet. I am just going
to look out for one at some of the
livery stables.”</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” said Roper,
with augmented interest, “I strongly
recommend you to do nothing of the
kind. These fellows will, to a dead
certainty, sell you some sort of a
brute that is either touched in the
wind or dead lame; and I can tell
you it is no joke to be spilt in a
charge of cavalry.”</p>

<p>I felt a sort of sickening sensation
as I recalled the lines of <span class="locked">Schiller——</span></p>

<p>The fate of Max might be mine,
and Edith might be left, a mournful
Thekla, to perform a moonlight pilgrimage
to my grave in the solitary
churchyard of Portobello!</p>

<p>“Do you really think so, Roper?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Think so! I know it,” replied
the dragoon. “Never while you live
trust yourself to the tender mercies of
a livery stable. It’s a regular maxim
in the army. Pray, are you a good
rider?”</p>

<p>“Pretty—fairish—tolerable. That
is, I <em>can</em> ride.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I see—want of practice
merely—eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
“Just so.”</p>

<p>“Well then, it’s a lucky thing that
I’ve seen you. I have just the sort
of animal you want—a regular-bred
horse, sound as a roach, quiet as a
lamb, and quite up to the cavalry
movements. Masaniello will suit your
weight to an ounce, and you shall
have him for seventy guineas.”</p>

<p>“That’s a very long price, Roper!”</p>

<p>“For Masaniello? I assure you
he’s as cheap as dirt. I would not
sell him for twice the sum: only, you
see, we are limited in our number, and
my father insists upon my keeping
other two which he bred himself. If
you like to enter Masaniello for the
races, I’ll ensure your winning the
cup.”</p>

<p>“Oh do, Mr M’Whirter, take Mr
Roper’s advice!” said Edith. “Masaniello
is such a pretty creature, and
so quiet! And then, after the week is
over, you know you can come and
ride with us.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take sixty, Roper?”</p>

<p>“Not a penny less than seventy,”
replied the dragoon.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I shall take him at
that. Pounds?”</p>

<p>“Guineas. Call down to-morrow
forenoon at Piershill, and you shall
have delivery. Now, Miss Bogle,
what do you say to a canter on the
sands?”</p>

<p>I took my leave rather satisfied
than otherwise with the transaction.
Edith evidently took a warm interest
in my welfare, and her suggestion as
to future expeditions was quite enchanting.
Seventy guineas, to be
sure, was a deal of money, but then
it was something to be assured of
safety for life and limb. On the street
I encountered Anthony Whaup.</p>

<p>“Well, old fellow,” quoth Anthony,
“how are you getting on?
Pounding away at drill, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Faith, you had better look sharp
about it, then. I’ve been down twice
at Canonmills of a morning, and I
can tell you the facings are no joke.
Have you got a horse yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes; a regular dragoon charger—and
you?”</p>

<p>“A beast from Wordsworth. He’s
been out regularly with the squadron
for the last ten years; so it is to be
presumed he knows the manœuvres.
If not, I’m a spilt yeoman!”</p>

<p>“I say, Anthony—can you ride?”</p>

<p>“No more than yourself, but I suppose
we shall contrive to stick on
somehow.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be as well to have
a trial?” said I, with considerable intrepidity.
“Suppose we go together
to the riding-school, and have an hour
or two’s practice.”</p>

<p>“I have no earthly manner of objection,”
said Anthony. “I suppose
there’s lots of sawdust there, and the
exhibition will, at any rate, be a private
one. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Allons!</i>” and we departed
for the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>We enquired for a couple of peaceable
hacks, which were forthwith furnished
us. I climbed up with some
difficulty into the saddle, and having
submitted to certain partial dislocations
of the knee and ankle, at the
hands of the master of the ring, (rather
a ferocious Widdicomb, by the
way,) and having also been instructed
in the art of holding the reins, I was
pronounced fit to start. Anthony,
whose legs were of a parenthetical
build, seemed to adopt himself more
easily to his seat.</p>

<p>“Now then, trot!” cried the sergeant,
and away we went with a wild
expenditure of elbow.</p>

<p>“Toes in, toes in, gentlemen!” continued
our instructor; “blowed but
you’d drive them wild if you had spurs
on! You ain’t been at the dancing-school
lately, have you? Steady—steady—very
good. Down your elbows,
gentlemen, if you please! them
bridles isn’t pumps. Heads up! now
gallop! Bravo! very good. Screw in
the knees a little. Hold on—hold on,
sir, or damme you’ll be off!”</p>

<p>And sure enough I was within an
ace of going over, having lost a stirrup,
when the sergeant caught hold
of me by the arm.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, gents,” he said,
“you’ll never learn to ride in this
’varsal world, unless you tries it without
the irons. Nothing like that for
giving a man a sure seat. So, Bill,
take off the stirrups, will you! Don’t
be afeard, gentlemen. I’ll make riders
of you yet, or my name isn’t Kickshaw.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the comforting assurances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
of Kickshaw, I felt considerably
nervous. If I could not maintain
my seat with the assistance of
the stirrups, what the mischief was I
to do without them? I looked rebelliously
at Anthony’s stirrup, but that
intrepid individual seemed to have
nerved himself to meet any possible
danger. His enormous legs seemed
calculated by nature to embrace the
body of his charger, and he sat erect
like an overgrown Bacchus bestriding
a kilderkin of beer.</p>

<p>“Trot, gentlemen!” and away we
went. I shall never forget the agony
of that hour! The animal I rode was
peculiarly decided in his paces; so
much so that at each step my <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">os
coccygis</i> came down with a violent
thump upon the saddle, and my teeth
rattled in my head like dice in a backgammon-box.
How I managed to
maintain my posture I cannot clearly
understand. Possibly the instinct of
self-preservation proved the best
auxiliary to the precepts of Sergeant
Kickshaw; for I held as tight a hold
of the saddle as though I had been
crossing the bridge of Al Sirat, with
the flames of the infernal regions
rolling and undulating beneath.</p>

<p>“Very good, gentlemen—capital!—you’re
improving vastly!” cried the
complimentary sergeant. “Nothing
like the bare saddle after all—damme
but I’ll make you take a four-barred
gate in a week! Now sit
steady. Gallop!”</p>

<p>Croton oil was a joke to it! I
thought my whole vitals were flying
to pieces as we bounded round the
oval building, the speed gradually increasing,
until in my diseased imagination
we were going at the pace of
Lucifer. My head began to grow
dizzy, and I clutched convulsively at
the pommel.</p>

<p>“An-tho-ny!” I gasped in monosyllables.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“How—do—you—feel?”</p>

<p>“Monstrous shakey,” replied Anthony
in dissyllables.</p>

<p>“I’m off!” cried I; and, losing my
balance at the turn, I dropped like a
sack of turnips.</p>

<p>However, I was none the worse for
it. Had it not been for Anthony, and
the dread of his report, I certainly
think I should have bolted, and renounced
the yeomanry for ever. But
a courageous example does wonders.
I persevered, and in a few days really
made wonderful progress. I felt,
however, considerably sore and stiff—straddled
as I walked along the street,
and was compelled to resort to
diachylon. What with riding and
the foot-drill I had hard work of it,
and earnestly longed for the time
when the regiment should go into
quarters. I almost forgot to mention
that Masaniello turned out to be an
immense black brute, rather aged,
but apparently sound, and, so far as I
could judge, quiet. There was, however,
an occasional gleam about his
eye which I did not exactly like.</p>

<p>“He’ll carry you, sir, famously—no
doubt of it,” said Kickshaw, who
inspected him; “and, mind my words,
he’ll go it at the charge!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>It was a brilliant July morning
when I first donned my regimentals
for actual service. Dugald M’Tavish,
a caddy from the corner of the street,
had been parading Masaniello, fully
caparisoned for action, before the door
at least half an hour before I was
ready, to the no small delectation of
two servant hizzies who were sweeping
out the stairs, and a diminutive
baker’s boy.</p>

<p>“Tak’ a cup o’ coffee afore ye get
up on that muckle funking beast,
Maister George,” said Nelly; “and
mind ye, that if ye are brocht hame
this day wi’ yer feet foremost, it’s no
me that has the wyte o’t.”</p>

<p>“Confound you, Nelly! what do
you keep croaking for in that way?”</p>

<p>“It’s a’ ane to me; but, O man,
ye’re unco like Rehoboam! Atweel
ye needna flounce at that gate. Gang
yer wa’s sodgerin’, and see what’ll
come o’t. It’s ae special mercy that
there’s a hantle o’ lint in the hoose,
and the auld imbrocation for broken
banes; and, in case o’ the warst, I’ll
ha’e the lass ready to rin for Doctor
Scouther.”</p>

<p>This was rather too much; so, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
the reverse of a benediction on my
gouvernante, I rushed from the house,
and, with the assistance of Dugald,
succeeded in mounting Masaniello, a
task of no small difficulty, as that
warlike quadruped persisted in effecting
a series of peripherical evolutions.</p>

<p>“And when wull ye be back, and
what wull ye ha’e for denner?” were
the last words shouted after me as I
trotted off to the rendezvous.</p>

<p>It was still early, and there were
not many people abroad. A few
faces decorated with the picturesque
mutch, occasionally appeared at the
windows, and one or two young
rascals doubtless descendants of the
disaffected who fell at Bonnymuir,
shouted “Dook!” as I rode along.
Presently I fell in with several of my
comrades, amongst whom I recognised
with pleasure Randolph and
Anthony Whaup.</p>

<p>“By Jove, M’Whirter!” said the
former, “that’s a capital mount of
yours. I don’t think there is a finer
horse in the troop; and I say, old
chap, you sit him as jauntily as a
janissary!”</p>

<p>“He has had hard work to do it
though, as I can testify,” remarked
Anthony, whose gelding seemed to
be an animal of enviable placidity.
“I wish you had seen us both at
Kickshaw’s a week ago.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but there’s nothing
like practice. Hold hard, M’Whirter!
If you keep staring up that way, you
may have a shorter ride of it than
you expect. Easy—man—easy! That
brute has the mettle of Beelzebub.”</p>

<p>The remark was not uncalled for.
We were passing at that moment
before the Bogles’ house, and I could
not resist the temptation of turning
round to gaze at the window of Edith,
in the faint hope that she might be a
spectator of our expedition. In doing
so, my left spur touched Masaniello
in the flank, a remembrancer which
he acknowledged with so violent a
caper, that I was very nearly pitched
from the saddle.</p>

<p>“Near shave that, sir!” said Hargate,
who now rode up to join us
“we’ll require to put you into the
rear rank this time, where, by the
way, you’ll be remarkably comfortable.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” said Anthony, “I may
be entitled to the same privilege.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Pounset, I think, will
be your front rank man. He’s quite
up to the whole manœuvre, only you
must take care of his mare. But here
we are at Abbey-hill gate, and just in
time.”</p>

<p>I was introduced in due form to
the officers of the squadron, with
none of whom I was previously acquainted,
and was directed to take
my place as Randolph’s rear rank
man, so that in file we marched together.
Before us were two veteran
yeomen, and behind were Anthony
and Pounset.</p>

<p>Nothing particular occurred during
our march to Portobello sands.
Masaniello behaved in a manner
which did him infinite credit, and
contributed not a little to my comfort.
He neither reared nor plunged but
contented him at times with a resolute
shake of the head, as if he disapproved
of something, and an occasional
sniff at Randolph’s filly, whenever
she brought her head too near.</p>

<p>On arriving at the sands we formed
into column, so that Anthony and I
were once more side by side. The
other squadrons of the regiment were
already drawn up, and at any other
time I should no doubt have considered
the scene as sufficiently imposing.
I had other things, however, to think
of besides military grandeur.</p>

<p>“I say, Anthony,” said I, somewhat
nervously, “do you know any thing
about these twistified manoeuvres?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not!” replied Whaup,
“I’ve been puzzling my brains for
the last three days over the Yeomanry
Regulations, but I can make nothing
out of their ‘Reverse flanks’ and
‘Reforming by sections of threes’?”</p>

<p>“And I’m as ignorant as a baby!
What on earth are we to do? That
big fellow of a sergeant won’t let us
stand quietly, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I stick to Pounset,” said Whaup.
“Whatever he does I do, and I advise
you to do the same by Randolph.”</p>

<p>“But what if they should ride away?
Isn’t there some disgusting nonsense
about forming from threes?”</p>

<p>“I suppose the horses know something
about it, else what’s the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
them? That brute of yours must
have gone through the evolutions a
thousand times, and ought to know
the word of command by heart—Hallo!—I
say, Pounset, just take care
of that mare of yours, will ye! She’s
kicking like the very devil, and my
beast is beginning to plunge!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be Pounset’s rear-rank
for twenty pounds,” said a stalwart
trooper to the left. “She has
the ugliest trick of using her heels of
any mare in Christendom.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged to you, sir, for the
information,” said Whaup, controlling,
with some difficulty, the incessant
curveting of his steed. “I say,
Pounset, if she tries that trick again
I’ll hamstring her without the slightest
ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Pooh—nonsense!” replied Pounset.
“Woa, Miss Frolic—woa, lass!—she’s
the gentlest creature in the
creation—a child might ride her with
a feather. Mere playfulness, my dear
fellow, I assure you!”</p>

<p>“Rot her playfulness!” cried Anthony;
“I’ve no idea of having my
brains made a batter pudding for the
amusement of a jade like that.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure, Whaup, that you
did not tickle her tail?” asked Pounset,
with provoking coolness. “She’s
a rare ’un to scatter a crowd.”</p>

<p>“Hang me if I’d come within three
yards of her if I possibly could help
it,” quoth Anthony. “If any gentleman
in the neighbourhood has a fancy
to exchange places, I’m his man.”</p>

<p>“Threes right!” cried the commanding-officer,
and we executed a
movement of which I am wholly unconscious;
for, to the credit of Masaniello
be it said, he took the direction
in his own mouth, and performed
it so as to save his rider from reproach.</p>

<p>Then came the sword exercise, consisting
of a series of slashes, which
went off tolerably well—then the skirmishing,
when one of our flank men
was capsized—and at last, to my
great joy, we were permitted to sit at
ease; that is, as easily as our previous
exertions would allow. I then learned
to appreciate the considerate attention
of the authorities in abrogating
the use of pistols. In each man’s
holsters was a soda-water bottle, filled
for the nonce with something more
pungent than the original Schweppe,
and a cigar case. These were now
called into requisition, and a dense
wreath of smoke arose along the lines
of the squadron. The officer then in
command embraced the opportunity
of addressing us in a pithy oration.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” said he, “I would
not be performing my duty to my
Queen and my country, (cheers,) if I
did not express to you my extreme
surprise and satisfaction at the manner
in which the new recruits have
gone through the preliminary drill.
Upon my honour I expected that more
than one-half of you would have been
spilt—a spectacle which might possibly
have been pleasing to those veteran
warriors of Dalmahoy, but which
I should have witnessed with extraordinary
pain. As it is, you rode like
bricks. However, it is my duty to
inform you, that a more serious trial
of your fortitude is about to come.
The squadrons will presently form together,
and you will be called upon
to charge. Many of you know very
well how to do that <span class="locked">already”——</span></p>

<p>“Especially the Writers to the
Signet,” muttered Anthony.</p>

<p>“But there are others who are new
to the movement. To these gentlemen,
therefore, I shall address a few
words of caution; they are short and
simple. Screw yourselves tight in
your saddles—hold hard at first—keep
together as you best can—think
that the enemy are before you—and
go at it like blazes!”</p>

<p>A shout of approval followed this
doughty address, and the heart of
every trooper burned with military
ardour. For my own part, I was becoming
quite reconciled to the thing.
I perfectly coincided with my commanding-officer
in his amazement at
the adhesive powers of myself and
several others, and with desperate
recklessness I resolved to test them to
the utmost. The bugle now sounded
the signal to fall in. Soda bottles
and cigar cases were returned to their
original concealment, and we once
more took our respective places in the
ranks.</p>

<p>“Now comes the fun,” said Randolph,
after the leading squadron had
charged in line. “Mind yourselves,
boys!”</p>

<p>“March—trot—gallop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
On we went like waves of the sea,
regularly enough at first, then slightly
inclining to the line of beauty, as
some of the weaker hacks began to
show symptoms of bellows.</p>

<p>“Cha—a—rge!”</p>

<p>“Go ahead!” cried Randolph, sticking
his spurs into his Bucephalus.
Masaniello, with a snort, fairly took
the bridle into his teeth, and dashed
off with me at a speed which threatened
to throw the ranks into utter
confusion. As for Pounset, he appeared
to be possessed with the fury of a
demon. His kicking mare sent up at
every stride large clods of sand in
the teeth of the unfortunate Anthony
Whaup, whose presence of mind
seemed at last to have forsaken him.</p>

<p>“What the mischief are you after,
Whaup?” panted the trooper on his
left. “Just take your foot out of
my stirrup, will you?”</p>

<p>“Devil a bit!” quoth Anthony
“I’m too glad to get any thing to hold
on by.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, you’re a gone ’coon.
There!—I told you.” And the steed
of Anthony was rushing riderless
among the press.</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly how we pulled
up. I have an indistinct notion that I
owed my own arrest to Neptune, and
that Masaniello was chest deep in the
sea before he paid the slightest attention
to my convulsive tugs at the
bridle. Above the rush of waves I
heard a yell of affright, and perceived
that I had nearly ridden over the carcass
of a fat old gentleman, who, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in
puris naturalibus</i>, was disporting himself
in the water; and who now, in an
agony of terror, and apparently under
the impression that he was a selected
victim for the tender mercies of the
yeomanry, struck out vigorously for
Inchkeith. I did not tarry to watch
his progress, but returned as rapidly
as possible to the squadron.</p>

<p>By this time the shores of Portobello
were crowded with habitual
bathers. There is a graceful <em>abandon</em>,
and total absence of prudery, which
peculiarly characterise the frequenters
of that interesting spot, and reminds
one forcibly of the manners of the
Golden Age. Hirsute Triton and
dishevelled Nereid there float in unabashed
proximity; and, judging from
the usual number of spectators, there
is something remarkably attractive in
the style of these aquatic exercises.</p>

<p>The tide was pretty far out, so that
of course there was a wide tract of
sand between the shingle and the sea.
Our squadron was again formed in
line, when a bathing-machine was
observed leisurely bearing down upon
our very centre, conveying its freight
towards the salubrious waters.</p>

<p>“Confound that boy!” cried the
commanding-officer; “he will be
among the ranks in a minute. Sergeant!
ride out, and warn the young
scoundrel off at his peril.”</p>

<p>The sergeant galloped towards the
machine.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, you young
scum of the earth? Do you not see
the troops before you? Get back this
instant!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do naething o’ the kind,” replied
the urchin, walloping his bare
legs, by way of encouragement, against
the sides of the anatomy he bestrode.
“The sands is just as free to huz
as to ony o’ ye, and I would like
to ken what richt ye have tae prevent
the foulks frae bathin’.”</p>

<p>“Do you dare to resist, you vagabond?”
cried the man of stripes, with
a terrific flourish of his sabre
“Wheel back immediately, or”——
and he went through the first four-cuts
of the sword exercise.</p>

<p>“Eh man!” said the intrepid
shrimp, “what wull ye do? Are
ye no ashamed, a great muckle fellie
like you, to come majoring, an’ shakin’
yer swurd at a bit laddie? Eh,
man, if I was ner yer size, I’d gie ye a
licking mysel’. Stand oot o’ the gate,
I say, an I’ll sune run through the
haill o’ ye. I’m no gaun to lose
saxpence for yeer nonsensical parauds.”</p>

<p>“Cancel my commission!” said the
lieutenant, “if the brat hasn’t bothered
the sergeant! The bathing-machine
is coming down upon us like
the chariot of Queen Boadicea! This
will never do. Randolph—you and
M’Whirter ride out and reinforce.
That scoundrel is another Kellerman,
and will break us to a dead certainty!”</p>

<p>“Twa mair o’ ye!” observed the
youth with incredible nonchalance, as
we rode up with ferocious gestures.
“O men, but ye’re bauld bauld the
day! Little chance the Frenchies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
wad hae wi’ the like o’ you ’gin they
were comin’! Gee hup, Bauldy!”</p>

<p>“Come, come, my boy,” said Randolph,
nearly choking with laughter,
“this is all very well, but you must
positively be off. Come, tumble round,
my fine fellow, and you shall have
leave to pass presently.”</p>

<p>“Aum no gaun to lose the tide that
way,” persevered the urchin. “The
sands is open to the haill o’ huz, and
I’ll no gang back for nane o’ ye. Gin
ye offer tae strike me, I’ll hae the
haill squad o’ ye afore the Provost o’
Portobelly, and, ma certie, there’ll
be a wheen heels sune coolin’ in the
jougs!”</p>

<p>“By heavens! this is absolutely
intolerable!” said the sergeant—“M’Whirter,
order the man in the
inside to open the door, and come out
in Her Majesty’s name.”</p>

<p>I obeyed, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“I say—you, sir, inside—do you
know where you are going? Right
into the centre of a troop of the Royal
Yeomanry Cavalry! If you are a
gentleman and a loyal subject, you
will open the door immediately, and
desire the vehicle to be stopped.”</p>

<p>In order to give due effect to this
remonstrance, and also to impress the
inmate with a proper sense of the
consequences of interference with martial
discipline, I bestowed cut No.
Seven with all my might upon the machine.
To my horror, and that of
my companions, there arose from
within a prolonged and double-voiced
squall.</p>

<p>“Hang me, if it isn’t women!”
said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Yer mither wull be proud o’ ye
the nicht,” said the Incubus on the
atomy, “when it’s tell’t her that ye
hae whanged at an auld machine, and
frichtet twa leddies to the skirlin’!
Ony hoo, M’Whirter, gin that’s your
name, there’ll be half-a-croun to pay
for the broken brodd!”</p>

<p>The small sliding-pannel at the
back of the machine was now cautiously
opened.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, Mr M’Whirter!”
said a voice which I instantly recognised
to be that of Edith Bogle, “is
it possible that can be you? Is it the
custom, sir, of the Scottish yeomen to
break in upon the privacy of two
young defenceless females, and even
to raise their weapons against the place
which contains them? Fie, sir! is
that your boasted chivalry?”</p>

<p>“O George—go away, do! I am
really quite ashamed of you!” said
the voice of my cousin, Mary Muggerland.</p>

<p>I thought I should have dropped
from my saddle.</p>

<p>“Friends of yours, eh, M’Whirter?”
said Randolph. “Rather an awkward
fix, I confess. What’s to be
done?”</p>

<p>“Would the regulars have behaved
thus?” cried Edith, with increased
animation. “Would <em>they</em> have insulted
a woman? Never. Begone,
sir—I am afraid I have been mistaken
in <span class="locked">you”——</span></p>

<p>“By my honour, Edith!—Miss
Bogle, I mean—you do me gross injustice!
I did not know—I could not
conceive that you, or Mary, or any
other lady, were in the machine, and
then—consider my <span class="locked">orders”——</span></p>

<p>“Orders, sir! There are some
orders which never ought to be obeyed.
But enough of this. If you have delicacy
enough to feel for our situation,
you will not protract this interview.
Drive on, boy! and you, Mr M’Whirter,
if you venture to interrupt us
further, never expect my pardon.”</p>

<p>“Nor mine!” added Mary Muggerland.</p>

<p>“Who the mischief cares for yours,
you monkey!” muttered I <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i>.
“But Edith—one other <span class="locked">word”——</span></p>

<p>“Don’t call me Edith, sir! This
continued importunity is insufferable!
If you have any explanation
to make, you must select a fitter time,”
and the sliding-pannel was instantly
closed.</p>

<p>“Ye’ve cotched it ony hoo!” said
the shrimp, with a malignant leer.
“Wauken up, Bauldy, my man, and
see how cleverly ye’ll gae through
them!”</p>

<p>A few words of explanation satisfied
our commanding-officer, and the
victorious machine rolled insultingly
through the lines. I have not spirits
to narrate the further proceedings of
that day. My heart was not in the
squadron; and my eyes, even when
ordered to be directed to the left,
were stealthily turned in the other
direction towards two distant figures
in bathing-gowns, sedulously attempting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
to drown one another in fun.
Shortly afterwards we dispersed, and
returned to Edinburgh. I attempted
a visit of explanation, but Miss Bogle
was not at home.</p>

<p>I messed that evening for the first
time with the squadron. Judging
from the laughter which arose on all
sides, it was a merry party; but my
heart was heavy, and I could hardly
bring myself to enter cordially into
the festivities. I was also rather
uneasy in person, as will happen to
young cavalry soldiers. I drank,
however, a good deal of wine, and,
as I was afterwards informed, recovered
amazingly towards the end of
the sederunt. They also told me
next morning, that I had entered
Masaniello to run for the Squadron
Cup.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter IV.</span></h3>

<p>“And so you really forgive me,
Edith!” said I, bending over the lady
of my love, as she sate creating worsted
roses in a parterre of gossamer
canvass; “you are not angry at what
happened the other day at that unlucky
encounter on the sands?”</p>

<p>“Have I not said already that I
forgive you?” replied Edith. “Is
it necessary that I should assure you
twice?”</p>

<p>“Charming Miss Bogle! you do
not know how happy you have made
me.”</p>

<p>“Pray, don’t lean over me so, or
you’ll make me spoil my work. See—I
have absolutely put something
like a caterpillar in the heart of this
rosebud!”</p>

<p>“Never, dearest lady, may any
caterpillar prey upon the rosebud of
your happiness. How curious! Do
you know, the outline of that sketch
reminds me forcibly of the countenance
of Roper?”</p>

<p>“Mr M’Whirter!”</p>

<p>“Nay, I was merely jesting.
Pray, Miss Bogle, what are your
favourite colours?”</p>

<p>“Peach blossom and scarlet; but
why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Do not press me for an explanation—it
will come early enough.
And now, Edith, I must bid you
adieu.”</p>

<p>“So soon? Cannot you spare a
single hour from your military duties?
Bless me, how pale you are looking!
Are you sure you are quite well?”</p>

<p>“Quite—that is to say a little
shaken in the nerves or so. This
continued <span class="locked">exertion”——</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean at mess? Mr
Roper told me sad stories about your
proceedings two nights ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pooh-nonsense! You will
certainly then appear at the races?”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon me.”</p>

<p>And so I took my leave.</p>

<p>The reader will gather from this
conversation, which took place four
days after the events detailed in last
chapter, that I had effectually made
my peace with Miss Bogle. For this
arrangement Mary Muggerland took
much more credit than I thought she
was entitled to; however, it is of no
use quarrelling with the well disposed,
especially if they are females, as, in
that case, you are sure to have the
worst of it in the long run. I did not
feel quite easy, however, regarding
the insinuations thrown out upon my
unusually pallid appearance. The
fact is, that the last week had rather
been a fast one. The mess was remarkably
pleasant, and all would
have been quite right had we stopped
there. But I had unfortunately
yielded to the fascinations of Archy
Chaffinch and some of the younger
hands, who, being upon the loose, resolved
to make the very most of it,
and the consequence was, that, to the
great scandal of Nelly, we kept highly
untimeous hours. In fact, one night
I made a slight mistake, which I have
not yet, and may never hear, the last
of, by walking, quite accidentally,
into the house of my next-door neighbour—a
grave and reverend signior—instead
of my own, and abusing him
like a pickpocket for his uncalled-for
presence within the shade of my patrimonial
lobby. It therefore followed,
that sometimes of a morning,
after mounting Masaniello, I had a
strong suspicion that a hive of bees had
taken a fancy to settle upon my helmet—a
compliment which might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
been highly satisfactory to the infant
Virgil, but was by no means suited to
the nerves or taste of an adult Writer
to the Signet.</p>

<p>Roper had been my guest at one
of the late messes. His speech in returning
thanks for the health of his
regiment was one of the richest specimens
of oratory I ever had the good
fortune to hear, and ought to be embalmed
for the benefit of an aspiring
posterity. It ran somewhat <span class="locked">thus——</span></p>

<p>“I assure you, sir, that the honour
you have just conferred upon ours, is—yas—amply
appweciated, I assure
you, sir, by the wegular army. It gives
us, sir—yas—the hiwest gwatification
to be pwesent at the mess of such a
loyal body as the South-Lothian Yeomanry
Cavalry. The distinguished
services of that gallant corps, both at
home and abwoad, are such as—yas—to
demand the admiwation of their
country, and—yas—in short, I feel
compwetely overpowared. The bwoad
banners of Bwitain floating over land
and sea—chalk cliffs of old Albion, if
I may be allowed the simile—wight
hand of the service and left—wegulars
and yeomanry—and the three corners
of the world may come at once in
arms, and be considewably shocked
for their pains. Permit me again to
expwess my extweme thanks for the
honour you have done to ours.”</p>

<p>Now, on that evening, as I can
conscientiously vouch, Roper contrived
to deposit at least two bottles of
claret beneath his belt. Any revelations,
therefore, of what took place at
our hospitable board, amounted to a
gross breach of confidence, and were
quite unpardonable; more especially
when our relative situations with regard
to the affections of Miss Bogle
are considered. But Punic faith is
the very least that one can expect
from a rival.</p>

<p>On the review day, the whole regiment
turned out under auspices of
unusual smartness. We were to be
inspected by a veteran officer of high
rank and reputation, and, under these
circumstances, we all thought ourselves
bound in honour to support the
credit of the corps. This was not
remarkably difficult. You will hardly
see anywhere a finer-looking set of
fellows than the Mid-Lothian yeomanry,
and our discipline, considering
the short period of exercise, was really
praiseworthy. In the words of our
commanding-officer, he was justly
proud of his recruits, and I can answer
for it, that the recruits most
cordially reciprocated the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Now, Anthony,” said Pounset, as
we formed into line, “I shall really
be obliged to you to make less clatter
with that scabbard of yours when we
charge. My mare is mad enough
with the music, without having the
additional impetus of supposing that
a score of empty kettles are tied to
her tail.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s a good one!”
replied Anthony. “Here have you
been bunging up my eyes and making
attempts upon my ribs for the last
week, and yet you expect me to have
no other earthly consideration beyond
your personal comfort! How the
deuce am I to manage my scabbard
when both hands are occupied?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you follow the example of
Prince Charles, and throw it away?”</p>

<p>“Thank you for nothing. But, I
say, that sort of madness seems contagious.
Here’s M’Whirter’s horse
performing a fandango, which is far
more curious than agreeable.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Masaniello?”
cried Archy Chaffinch; “he
looks seriously inclined to bolt.”</p>

<p>I had awful suspicions of the same
nature. No sooner had the regimental
band struck up, than my
charger began to evince disagreeable
signs of impatience; he pawed, pranced,
snorted, curveted, and was utterly
deaf to the blandishments with which
I strove to allay his irritability. I
was even thankful when we were put
into motion preparatory to the charge,
in the belief that action might render
him less restive; and so it did for a
time. But no sooner had we broke
into a gallop, than I felt it was all up
with me. I might as well have been
without a bridle. The ungovernable
brute laid back his ears like a tiger,
and I shot past Randolph in an instant,
very nearly upsetting that judicious
warrior in my course.</p>

<p>Nor was I alone. Pounset’s mare,
who never brooked a rival, and who,
moreover, had taken umbrage at the
sonorous jolting of Anthony, was resolved
not to be outstripped; and,
taking the bridle between her teeth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
came hard and heavy on my flank.
The cry of “halt!” sounded far and
faint behind us. We dashed past a
carriage, in which, from a momentary
glimpse, I recognised the form of
Edith; while a dragoon officer—I
knew intuitively it was Roper—had
drawn up his horse by the side. They
were laughing—yes! by heavens they
were laughing—at the moment I was
borne away headlong, and perhaps
to destruction. My sword flew out
of my hand—I had need of both to
hold the reins. I shouted to Pounset
to draw in, but an oath was the only
reply!</p>

<p>I heard the blast of the recall
bugle behind us, but Masaniello only
stretched out more wildly. We
splashed through the shallow pools
of water, sending up the spray behind
us; and onwards—onwards we went
towards Joppa, with more than the
velocity of the wind.</p>

<p>“Have a care, M’Whirter!” shouted
Pounset. “Turn his head to the sea
if you can. There’s a quicksand right
before you!”</p>

<p>I could as easily have converted a
Mussulman. I saw before me a dark
streak, as if some foul brook were
stagnating on the sands. There was
a dash, a splash, a shock, and I was
catapulted over the ears of Masaniello.</p>

<p>I must have lost consciousness, I
believe, for the next thing I remember
was Pounset standing over me,
and holding my quadruped by the
bridle.</p>

<p>“We may thank our stars it is no
worse,” said he; “that stank fairly
took the shine out of your brute, and
brought him to a stand-still. Are
you hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not much. But I say, what a
figure I am!”</p>

<p>“Not altogether adapted for an
evening party, I admit. But never
mind. There’s a cure for every thing
except broken bones. Let’s get back
again as fast as we can, for the captain
will be in a beautiful rage!”</p>

<p>We returned. A general acclamation
burst from the squadron as we
rode up, but the commanding-officer
looked severe as Draco.</p>

<p>“Am I to conclude, gentlemen,”
said he, “that this exhibition was a
trial of the comparative merits of your
horses preparatory to the racing?
Upon such an occasion as this I must
<span class="locked">say”——</span></p>

<p>“Just look at M’Whirter, captain,”
said Pounset, “and then judge for
yourself whether it was intentional.
The fact is, my mare is as hot as
ginger, and that black horse has no
more mouth than a brickbat!”</p>

<p>“Well, after all, he <em>does</em> seem in a
precious mess. I am sure it was a
mere accident, but don’t let it happen
again. Fall in, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>There was, however, as regarded
myself, considerable opposition to this
order.</p>

<p>“Why, M’Whirter, you’re not going
to poison us to death, are you?” said
Anthony Whaup. “Pray keep to the
other side, like a good fellow—you’re
not just altogether a bouquet.”</p>

<p>“Do they gut the herrings down
yonder, M’Whirter?” asked Archy
Chaffinch. “Excuse me for remarking
that your flavour is rather full
than fragrant.”</p>

<p>“I wish they had allowed smoking
on parade!” said a third. “It
would require a strong Havannah
to temper the exhalations of our comrade.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better go home at
once?” suggested Randolph. “My
horse is beginning to cough.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes!” cried half-a-dozen.
“Go home at once.”</p>

<p>“And if you are wise,” added Hargate,
“take a dip in the sea—boots,
helmet, pantaloons, and all.”</p>

<p>I obtained permission, and retired
in a state of inconceivable disgust.
Towards the carriage where Edith
was seated, I dared not go; and with
a big and throbbing heart I recollected
that she had witnessed my disgrace.</p>

<p>“But she shall yet see,” I mentally
exclaimed, “that I am worthy
of her! Once let me cast this foul
and filthy slough—let me don her
favourite colours—let me win the
prize, as I am sure I ought to do, and
the treasure of her heart may be mine!—You
young villain! if you make
faces at me again, I shall fetch you a
cut over the costard!”</p>

<p>“Soor dook!” shouted the varlet.
“Eh! see till the man that’s been
coupit ower in the glaur!”</p>

<p>I rode home as rapidly as possible.
I throw a veil over the triumphant
ejaculations of Nelly at the sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
my ruined uniform, and the personal
allusions she made to the retreat and
discomfiture of the Philistines. That
evening I avoided mess, and courted
a sound sleep to prepare me for the
fatigues of the ensuing day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>“Here is a true, correct, and particular
account, of the noblemen, gentlemen,
and yeomen’s horses, that is
to run this day over the course of
Musselburry, with the names, weights,
and liveries of the riders, and the
same of the horses themselves!”</p>

<p>Such were the cries that saluted
me, as next day I rode up to the race-course
of Musselburgh. I purchased
a card, which among other entries
contained the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<p class="p1 b0 center"><span class="smcap">Edinburgh Squadron Cup, 12 Stone.</span></p>
<blockquote class="hang">
<p>Mr <span class="smcap">A. Chaffinch’s</span> br. g. <span class="smcap">Groggyboy</span>—<i>Green and White Cap</i>.</p>
<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Randolph</span> ns. b. g. <span class="smcap">Cheeser</span>—<i>Geranium and French Grey</i>.</p>
<p>Mr <span class="smcap">M’Whirter’s</span> bl. g. <span class="smcap">Masaniello</span>—<i>Peach-blossom and Scarlet</i>.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Shakerley</span> ns. b. g. <span class="smcap">Spontaneous Combustion</span>—<i>White body and Liver-coloured sleeves</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>I made my way to the stand. Miss
Bogle and Mary Muggerland were
there, but so also was the eternal
Roper.</p>

<p>“Ah, M’Whirter!” said the latter.
“How do you feel yourself
this morning? None the worse of
your tumble yesterday, I hope?
Mere accident, you know. Spiwited
cweature Masaniello, it must be confessed.
’Gad, if you can make him
go the pace as well to-day, you’ll
distance the whole of the rest of
them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr M’Whirter! I’m <em>so</em> glad
to see you!” said Edith. “How
funny you looked yesterday when
you were running away! Do you
know that I waved my handkerchief
to you as you passed, but you were
not polite enough to take any notice?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, Miss Bogle, I had something
else to think of at that particular
moment.”</p>

<p>“You were <em>not</em> thinking about
me, then?” said Edith. “Well, I
can’t call that a very gallant speech.”</p>

<p>“I’ll lay an even bet,” said Roper,
“that you were thinking more about
the surgeon.”</p>

<p>“Were you ever wounded, Mr
Roper?” said I.</p>

<p>“Once—in the heart, and incurably,”
replied the coxcomb, with a
glance at Edith.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! because if you had been,
you would scarce have ventured to
select the surgeon as the subject of a
joke. But I forgot. These are times
of peace.”</p>

<p>“When men of peace become soldiers,”
retorted Roper.</p>

<p>“I declare you are very silly!”
cried Edith; “and I have a good
mind to send both of you away.”</p>

<p>“Death rather than banishment!”
said Roper.</p>

<p>“Well, then, do be quiet! I take
<em>such</em> an interest in your race, Mr
M’Whirter. Do you know I have
two pairs of gloves upon it? So you
must absolutely contrive to win. By
the way, what are your colours?”</p>

<p>“Peach-blossom and scarlet.”</p>

<p>“How very gallant! I take it
quite as a compliment to myself.”</p>

<p>“M’Whirter! you’re wanted,”
cried a voice from below.</p>

<p>“Bless me! I suppose it is time
for saddling. Farewell, Edith—farewell,
Mary! I shall win if I possibly
can.”</p>

<p>“Good-by!” said Roper. “Stick
on tightly and screw him up, and
there’s no fear of Masaniello.”</p>

<p>“Where the deuce have you been,
M’Whirter?” said Randolph. “Get
into the scales as fast as you can.
You’ve been keeping the whole of us
waiting.”</p>

<p>“I’ll back Masaniello against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
field at two to one,” said Anthony
Whaup.</p>

<p>“Done with you, in ponies,”
said Patsey Chaffinch, who was assisting
his brother from the scales.</p>

<p>“Do you feel nervous, M’Whirter?”
asked Hosier, a friend who
was backing me rather heavily. “You
look a little white in the face.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth—I do.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad. Had you not better
take a glass of brandy?”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea;” and I took
it.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Now canter him
about a little, and you’ll soon get used
to it.”</p>

<p>I shall carefully avoid having any
occasion to make use of my dear-bought
experience. I felt remarkably sheepish
as I rode out upon the course, and
heard the observations of the crowd.</p>

<p>“And wha’s yon in the saumon-coloured
jacket?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be him they ca’ Chaffinch.”</p>

<p>“Na, man—yon chield wad make
twa o’ Chaffinch. He’s but a feather-wecht
o’ a cratur.”</p>

<p>“Wow, Jess! but that’s a bonnie
horse!”</p>

<p>“Bonnier than the man that’s on
it, ony how.”</p>

<p>“Think ye that’s the beast they ca’
Masonyellow?”</p>

<p>“I’m thinkin’ sae. That man can
ride nane. He’s nae grupp wi’ his
thees.”</p>

<p>These were the sort of remarks
which met my ears as I paced along,
nor, as I must confess, was I particularly
elated thereby. Pounset now
rode up.</p>

<p>“Well, M’Whirter, we are to have
another sort of race to-day. I half
fear, from the specimen I have seen of
Masaniello, that my little mare runs a
poor chance; but Chaffinch will give
you work for it—Groggyboy was a
crack horse in his day. But come,
there goes the bell, and we are wanted
at the starting-post.”</p>

<p>The remainder of my story is short.</p>

<p>“Ready, gentlemen?—Off!” and
away we went, Spontaneous Combustion
leading, Miss Frolic and Groggyboy
next, Randolph and myself following,
and Hargate bringing up the
rear on Loupowerher, who never had
a chance. After the first few seconds,
when all was mist before my eyes, I
felt considerably easier. Masaniello
was striding out vigorously, and I
warmed insensibly to the work. The
pace became terrific. Spon. Bus. gradually
gave way, and Groggyboy took
the lead. I saw nothing more of Randolph.
On we went around the race-course
like a crowd of motley demoniacs,
whipping, spurring, and working
at our reins as if thereby we were
assisting our progression. I was resolved
to conquer or to die.</p>

<p>Round we came in sight of the assembled
multitude. I could even hear
their excited cries in the distance.
Masaniello was now running neck and
neck with Groggyboy—Miss Frolic
half-a-length before!</p>

<p>And now we neared the stand. I
thought I could see the white fluttering
of Edith’s handkerchief—I clenched
my teeth, grasped my whip, and
lashed vigorously at Masaniello. In
a moment more I should have been
a-head—but there was a crash, and
then oblivion.</p>

<p>Evil was the mother that whelped
that cur of a butcher’s dog! He ran
right in before Masaniello, and horse
and man were hurled with awful violence
to the ground. I forgive Masaniello.
Poor brute! his leg was
broken, and they had to shoot him on
the course. He was my first and last
charger.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was picked up insensible,
and conveyed home upon a
shutter, thereby fulfilling to the letter
the ominous prophecies of Nelly, who
cried the coronach over me. Two of
my ribs were fractured, and for three
weeks I was confined to bed with a
delirious fever.</p>

<p>“What noise is that below stairs,
Nelly?” asked I on the second morning
of my convalescence.</p>

<p>“’Deed, Maister George, I’m thinking
it’s just the servant lass chappin’
coals wi’ yer swurd.”</p>

<p>“Serve it right. And what parcel
is that on the table?</p>

<p>“I dinna ken: it came in yestreen.”</p>

<p>“Give it me.”</p>

<p>“Heaven and earth! Wedding-cake
and cards! <span class="smcap">Mr and Mrs
Roper</span>!”</p>

<h2 id="WATER">THE WATER-CURE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center p0 b2">[<cite>Life at the Water-Cure; or, a Month at Malvern. A Diary.</cite> By <span class="smcap">Richard J.
Lane</span>. London: 1846.]</p>

<p>In the biographies of the Seven
Sages of Greece, some interesting
incidents have escaped even the discursive
and vigilant erudition of
Bayle. All of these worthies, in fact,
being original members and perpetual
vice-presidents of the Fogie Club,
they were, naturally, as prosy octogenarians
as the amber of history
ever preserved for the admiration of
posterity. But Thales of Miletus we
imagine to have easily outstripped his
six compeers in soporific garrulity;
because an author whose name, while
it would be Greek to the illiterate, is
sufficiently familiar, without being
mentioned, to the scholar, and who
flourished long enough after the
people of whom he speaks to give
weight to his statements, has particularly
recorded, that the Ionic philosopher
was universally called by his
friends, behind his back, “Old Hygrostroma.”
This euphonical and
distinctive epithet we have discovered,
by dint of deep study, to mean,
very literally, “Old Wet-Blanket.”
Assigning an equal value to ancient
and modern phraseology, the portrait
of the Milesian, so characterised,
wears an ugly aspect. Our own
martyrdom, under the relentless persecutions
of his legitimate successors,
concentrates, by an instinctive
process of mental association, all their
worst features in the single physiognomy
of their prototype. How
many luxuriant posies of fancy and
humour, ready to burst into brilliant
blossom, have irrecoverably drooped—how
many</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fair occasions, gone for ever by,”<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="in0">of refreshing a laborious day by the
evening carnival of nonsense—how
many glorious “high jinks,” <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">infandum
renovare dolorem</i>, have been
stifled—beneath the dank suffocation
of this water-kelpy of social enjoyment!
It is proper, therefore, in
order to be just, to ascertain whether
the stigma which Thales carried
about with him can be traced to the
same causes which hang similar
labels round the necks of men in our
own day, or whether a term of reproach
or of ridicule may not here, as
in many other instances, have been
widely diverted from, or excessively
aggravated in, its original signification.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the mind of
the wise man was filled by a crotchet,
which absorbed all other ideas. He
announced to the world that water is
the primal element, the essence, the
seed, the embryo of all matter.
Every thing, throughout the whole
area of the universe, however ponderous
or substantial, however complex
or varied, was not merely evolved
from the liquid laboratory, but was
actually part and parcel of the radical
fluid itself. Earth and fire, the azure
heaven and the golden stars, marble
and brass, birds and beasts, fruits
and flowers, ay, men and women,
were dew-drops, in different phases of
configuration, and different stages of
condensation. Such a doctrine, inculcated
with endless iteration and
intolerable prolixity, could not but
exhaust the patience of the gay and
dissipated Ionians, whose habits, we
know, were far from being circumscribed
by the rules and regulations
of a total abstinence society. And
although, even when the topic had
become nauseously stale, a little hilarity
might be excited by the old
gentleman falling easily into the trap,
and answering in harmony with his
favourite theory, when tauntingly
asked, if the glowing forms before
him, whose witchery of grace had
passed into a proverb, were indeed
emanations from the muddy Mæander;
or if the neighbouring Latmus, where</p>

<p class="in0">was no more than a pitcherful of the
Ægean; or if the pyramids, whose altitude
he had measured for the wondering
priests of Isis, were but bubbles
of the Nile. Still the echo of the
merriment thus provoked was faint
and feeble beside the vociferous uproar
which shook the voluptuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
chambers when young Anaximander,
in whom Thales fondly thought he
saw a disciple, ere yet the shadow of
his deluded master had glided over
the threshold, filled a ruddy bumper
to the brim, and dashed down with a
shout his libation to Bacchus, in
thankfulness that at last they were
rid of “Hygrostroma.” Flesh and
blood could not bear for ever “the
dreadful noise of water in their ears;”
and so, most deservedly and fitly,
Thales got the name of “Wet-Blanket,”
and bequeathed it, we regret to
acknowledge, to an infinite line of
descendants, who, in dealing with
other themes, daily and hourly, after
their own fashion, stabilitate and
eclipse his renown.</p>

<p>From the days of Thales, which
may be fixed, according to the nicest
calculations, about four-and-twenty
hundred years ago, water was generally
understood to have found its
level. Occasionally, no doubt, it
made vigorous spurts to revindicate
its prominency, but never mounted
to the alarming flood-mark which it
had reached in the Ionic philosophy.
It certainly has had little reason to
complain of the position from which
it cannot be displaced. Covering entirely
three-fifths of the surface of the
globe, few are the specks of land, and
these few shunned by man, where its
influence is not paramount. Permeating
the vast economy of nature
through its grandest and its minutest
ramifications; nursing from its myriad
fountains and reservoirs the vitality
of creation; affecting and controlling
the salubrity of climates, the purity
and temperature of atmospheres, the
fertility of soils; moistening the parched
lips, and requickening the energies of
vegetation; bearing all the necessaries
and all the luxuries of life, all that
industry can furnish or opulence procure,
into the centre of immense continents,
and up to the doors of populous
cities; generating, with the help of
a strong ally, the most gigantic
power which human ingenuity has
ever tamed to the uses, and comforts,
and improvements of mankind; rolling
the rampart of its sleepless tides
round the shores and the independence
of mighty empires, and stretching
out its broad waters as the highway
of amicable intercourse between
all nations, this colossal and beneficent
element needs not to aspire higher than
the eminence where it must be raised
by such a contemplation of its virtues
and its strength. Regarding it, however,
with a homelier eye, we cannot
conceal our opinion that too many
men, women, and children, have underrated
its serviceable qualities in
connexion with their personal and
domestic welfare. Nor shall our observations,
desultory as they may be,
conclude without some serious reflections
on this subject, applicable to
our own country and our own times;
for even in the relaxing warmth
and idlesse of autumn, when nothing
very grave is very palatable, we
must coax our friends to swallow a
thin slice of instruction along with
our jests and their grouse. But in
the mean time, casting a rapid glance
from the Ionian era, whence we
started, downwards to the present
century, over the aquatic propensities
which have distinguished successive
generations in the intervening ages,
it can scarcely be affirmed with truth
that the efficacy of water, as an useful,
agreeable, and a sanative boon
from Providence to man, has been
neglected and despised. The Greeks,
the Romans, and the Orientals require
no justification. Their bathing,
shampooing, and anointing have survived
the downfall of thrones and
the extinction of dynasties. And if
the inhabitants of less benign regions,
who must sometimes smash the ice
in their tubs before commencing a
lavation, do not evince the same
headlong predilection for continual
immersion and ceaseless ablution as do
their kindred of the genial South and
blazing East, we confess that their
apology seems to us to be remarkably
clear and satisfactory. What do we
think of Scotland?—is a query from
which a sensitive patriotism, perhaps,
might shrink. It does not abash us
at all. All ducklings do not plunge
into the pond or the stream exactly
at the same age—one exhibiting, in
this respect, a rash precocity, while
another will for a long time obstinately
refuse to acknowledge that</p>

<p>In short, Europe continued to maintain
most amicable relations, while
Asia cultivated the closest intimacy
with water, hot and cold, fresh and
salt. America is too young yet to
be included in the argument; and as
for Africa, crocodiles, hippopotami,
and sharks, usurp a monopoly of the
favourite pools so exclusively, that
the returns of its bathing statistics
are most uncertain. In this course,
matters ran on smoothly for cycles
and cycles of years, races of men
following races, as waves follow
waves. Any perceptible alteration
in the relative positions of man and
water, at the same time, was in the
direction of stricter and more frequent
communication between them.
Cleanliness became fashionable—an
event which, without snapping the
connexion somewhat loosely subsisting
between the purifying element
and the inferior grades of society,
rapidly and widely diffused a knowledge
of its capabilities and its amiabilities
among the higher circles.
Well, on the dawn of a glorious
morning, when the sun, and all the
seas, lakes, and rivers of the globe
were playing at battledore and shuttle-cock
with the beams of the orb of
day, water suddenly found itself, at a
bound, lifted to a pinnacle only a
little beneath the summit on which
Thales of yore enthroned it. Matter,
on this occasion, it was not announced
to be—but the cure of all the afflictions
with which matter could be visited.
Ten thousand aromatic herbs
gracefully adjusted their petals, ere
they fell, and withered into rank and
noisome weeds; ten thousand apothecaries
were petrified in the act of

in that attitude remain, stony remembrances
of their own villanies; physicians
melted away by faculties and
colleges;</p>

<p class="in0">Numerous are the blunders under
which humanity has reposed in incurious
apathy. The sun gamboled
round the earth so long, that, when
they changed places and motions, the
denizens at that moment of our planet
were cheated out of several days in
their sublunary or circumsolar career.
What was that mistake in comparison
with the disastrous error of having
for centuries obdurately turned
their backs on the inexhaustible laboratory
in which alone health could
be bought, and perversely purchased
destruction from a series of quacks,
whose infinite retails had caused more
wholsale ruin than the pernicious
wrath of Pelides? “Look here upon

to accede to the unpleasant
request we hurry to another phenomenon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
The inestimable discovery
of the Water-Cure has proved the
posthumous triumph of Old Hygrostroma.
Instead of being a damper
to good-fellowship, the wet-blanket
is synonimous with, and symbolical,
and productive of all that is vivacious,
hilarious, obstreperous, and jolly.
A dozen of champagne is not an
equivalent for the “<span class="smcap">Sheet</span>;” and
when you are once properly “packed,”
by the mere flow of your animal
spirits, and a tumbler of pure spring
water, you shall “sew up” the most
potential toper and wit, whose facetiousness
grows with the consumption
of his wine.</p>

<p>Here we perceive that our readers,
by an unmistakeable twitch of the
muscles of the face, intimate their
suspicions that our fidelity to the
water system is impeachable. An
explanatory sentence is unavoidable.
In the month of August, we are
always like Napoleon at Elba, confident
of the incorruptible attachment
of our adherents, but at a considerable
distance from every one of them—certain
of re-assuming, in undiminished
splendour, and amidst thunders
of acclamation, our undisputed sway
on the first of September, but much
at a loss a week before our return to
find a bark, however frail, in which
to trust our fortunes—projecting stupendous
expeditions with invincible
armies, and, in the meanwhile, possessing
not even a recruit from the
awkward squad to put through his
facings. The days were insufferably
hot or unmitigably rainy. Nobody
cared about news, nor did anybody
send us grouse. The Benledi steamboat
was stranded with a broken back
on a rock of the Fifeshire coast; and
harrowing paragraphs represented all
the railways in every direction as
strewed with the “disjecta membra”
of ill-fated travellers. The thunder
and lightning deafened and blinded
us, while the absence of all
companionship reduced us to compulsory
dumbness. In this torpor of the soul
and confusion of the intellect, looking
up with a vacant stare to the cupola,
on which the firmament was playing
with inimitable rapidity a fierce prelude,
we were startled by the appearance
of Mr Lane’s elegant and agreeable
volume. It found us in no very
consecutive or severely logical mood.
The engravings were amusing—the
writing was pleasant. Having skimmed
the contents with our customary
velocity, we flung ourselves back upon
the downy slopes of our autumn ottoman,
and poured forth the rhapsody
which has bewildered our friends. It
could not well be otherwise. There
was such implicit faith in Mr Lane—in
union with so much good feeling
and good sense—pleading his case so
fervently—interesting us so much in
himself, his illness and his recovery,
his relapses and his mendings, his
packing and scrubbing, his company
and his talk, his walks and his rides,
his digestions and reflections, and
leaving us in the end so little convinced
of the unquestionable superiority
of the treatment which had
bettered him, and no doubt many
others, that, assured of there being
nothing new under the sun, we took
our flight back into the olden times
to recall, if we could, when water ever
aspired so loftily before in popular
estimation. Icarus-like, we dropped
into the bosom of the Ægean, and
were dragged up opportunely by the
phantom of Thales at Miletus.</p>

<p>Captivating, we admit, is the notion
that water cures all diseases. There
is a grandeur in the simplicity, and a
rapture in the tastelessness of such a
medicine, which its motley competitors
cannot approach. Did any one
ever see physic, which, by its appearance,
infused love for it at first sight,
and a vehement longing to swallow
it? Revolve how endless in variety
of colour and substance are the contents
of a medicine-chest, and confess
that you have not been able to look
at one of them with satisfaction. The
mature mind recoils from terrible reminiscences;
and at the apparition of
some single phial, a hideous congregation
of detestable tastes, starting
from the crevices of memory, will rush
into the palate, and resuscitate the
forgotten tortures and trials of infancy
and boyhood. To be spared all this
were “a consummation devoutly to
be wished.” To know that no shock
sharper than the douche, and no
draught more nauseous than half-a-dozen
tumblers of water, should ever,
at the doctors hand, visit or wrack
the frame might subdue the refractory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
temper of patients. To throw
physic to the dogs, and be cleansed
of all perilous stuff by a currycomb
and a pail, might reconcile us to be
assimilated to the horse. But alas!
what do we discern in man, “the paragon
of animals,” which will entitle
us to conclude that his innumerable
bodily frailties can be so overcome or
expelled?</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Oh, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Happy and painful experiences unite
to prove it. It has cost the labour
and the zeal, the intense concentration
of the undivided energies, and,
in memorable instances, the very lives
of the erudite and the ingenious, the
sagacious and the daring, engaged in
an incalculable multiplicity of investigations,
experiments, and observations,
in all ages and in all countries,
to explore, and test, and confirm what
is valuable, trustworthy, and stable,
in medical science. Even to-day it
may be urged that much is still obscure,
indefinite, unsteady, and liable
to be overturned and dismissed by the
clearer illumination of to-morrow.
Be it so. But, in spite of all the
lengths to which the objection can
be pushed, there remain two points
irrefragably settled in medicine. First
of all, there are certain remedies ascertained,
beyond the shadow of a doubt,
to act efficaciously on certain diseases.
In the second place—and by far the
most important truth for us in this
discussion—no one specific remedy
has ever been discovered which applies
efficaciously to all diseases, nor to the
overwhelming majority, nay, nor to
any majority of all diseases. A period
of ten years never elapses without
such a panacea being broached, paraded,
and extinguished. The “impar
congressus Achillei” is made manifest
in every case. At the outset, accordingly,
an advertisement of the
Cold Water-Cure as a specific brands
it with a suspicion which has never
been false before. To affirm that,
from Galen to Abernethy, a veil of
impenetrable ignorance shrouded the
vision of all physicians, which prevented
them from picking up the truth
lying at their feet, is not to be more
arrogant than Holloway’s ointment,
or Morrison’s pills. It is, however,
to offer a statement for our acceptation
which common sense and the
practical testimony of more than two
thousand years simultaneously reject.
The question truly deserves no argument.
The publication of the discovery
of a panacea is sufficient. The
remedy, whatever it is, cannot be
what it pretends to be; although it
may be worse or better than it is generally
supposed to be. Those who
have been restored to convalescence,
to buoyancy of spirits, and agility of
limbs, by cold water, are at perfect
liberty to abjure and denounce all
other cures. But the chasm in the
reasoning is a yawning one, over
which an adventurous leap must be
taken, to stand firm on the other side
upon the conclusion that what cured
Richard of dyspepsia will deliver
Thomas from typhus.</p>

<p>It is not incumbent on us to enumerate
Mr Lane’s ailments. Blue
pill and black draught, taraxacum and
galvanism, were successively repelled
by the stubborn enemy, whose entrenchments
were to be neither sapped
nor stormed. In a lucky hour, “an
intimate friend of Sir E. Bulwer Lytton
detailed, with generous eloquence,
the great results of the Water-Cure in
many cases; and his own characteristic
benevolence prompted him to
press upon me, <em>as a duty</em>, the visit of
a month to Malvern.” So there he
goes. “The drive from Worcester to
Malvern is not marked by any particular
beauty, except the occasional
glimpses of the hills, and the constant
succession of rich orchards, at this
time luxuriant in apple blossoms.”
The trifling exception to the monotony
of the landscape, which does not escape
his notice, almost suggests the
<em>possibility</em> of the patient being a little
better already.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Here I am in the temple dedicated
to Dame Nature and the Elixir Vitæ.
The Doctor not at home, but a message
that we are expected at a <em>pic-nic</em> at
St Anne’s Well. Too tired to go, we
went to our comfortable double-bedded
room, and, being refreshed, waited for
the Doctor, who soon returned, and
severely scrutinized me. He found my
boy in exactly the state which he had
expected, and rubbed his hands with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
delight in anticipation of the change to
be wrought in him. To me he boldly
said, ‘Give me a month, and I will
teach you to manage yourself at home.’
At supper (eight o’clock) we were
presented to our fellow patients, all
graciously and gracefully welcoming
the new-comers. This is the final meal
of the day, consisting of bread in many
varieties, butter, and biscuits, with bottles
of water and jugs of milk. Tea,
although allowed in some cases, is not
encouraged. The house overlooks the
beautiful Abbey church. The monks
always knew how to avail themselves of
the charms of situation; sheltered by
the hills, and yet overlooking the extensive
plain, and receiving the first
rays of the sun—nothing could be more
lovely.</p>

<p>“Doctor examined and asked me
divers questions, and then gave his
orders to the bath attendant. To bed
at ten.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The compliment to the discrimination
of the monks might not be inappropriately
transferred to Dr Wilson.
There are more things in the Water-Cure
than cold water, and more than
the body frequently morbid or ill at
ease in the visitors to Malvern.
Lovely scenery is wholesome food for
a depressed mind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>May 14.</i>—At a little before seven
came the bath attendant. He poured
about four inches depth of water into a
tin bath, five feet long, and directed me
to get out of bed and sit in it. He then
poured about two gallons of water on
my head, and commenced a vigorous
rubbing, in which I assisted. This is
called <span class="smcap smaller">THE SHALLOW BATH</span>. After three
or four minutes, I got out of the bath,
and he enveloped me in a dry sheet,
rubbing me thoroughly. All this friction
produced an agreeable glow, and
the desire to dress quickly and get into
the air was uppermost. The same process
was repeated with Ned; and, having
each taken a tumbler of water, we started
to mount the hill. I got as far as St
Anne’s Well, with Ned’s help, and,
drinking there, sauntered about the
exquisite terrace walks on the hill. The
fountain of St Anne’s Well is constantly
flowing, and though varying in quantity,
has never failed. I am told that the
water is at nearly the same temperature
in summer as in winter. In sparkling
brilliancy, as well as purity, it is confessedly
unrivalled even at Malvern,
except by the water of the ‘Holy Well.’
A cottage, beautifully situated in the
hollow of this eminence, encloses the
fountain, where it escapes from the
rock; the chief apartment of which is
free, and open to all who wish to drink;
but it is good taste to put down a half-crown
upon the first visit, and inscribe
a name in the book, which (with a ready
pen) is also ‘open to all.’ From this
cottage, which is I found a favourite
place of rendezvous, paths lead by various
routes to the highest hill called the
Worcestershire Beacon, and the other
commanding heights. We shall see, I
trust.</p>

<p>“Another glass of this exquisite water,
and home to breakfast at nine. Several
sorts of bread (all in perfection) and
excellent butter; bottles of the brightest
water and tumblers duly arranged on
the table; jugs of milk for those who
like it, and to whom it is allowed. One
jug <em>smokes</em>, and the well-known fragrant
flavour soon suggests to the nose <em>tea</em>!
Surely this is irregular, or why the disguise?
Why not a teapot?</p>

<p>“The Doctor took his seat at the head
of the table. In the place of honour
on his left was the patient whose longest
stay in the house entitled her to the
distinction. (I afterwards found that
precedence at table is arranged by this
rule, subject to the intermixture of the
gentlemen.) She is eminently gifted to
grace her position, being more than
pretty, and with tongue and manner to
match. Next to her is a gentleman of
a dissenting expression of countenance,
then another pretty woman, a young
man of distinguished manners, and another
<em>very</em> pretty woman, who, unlike
the two fair patients above her, is <em>dark</em>
in all that beautifies a brilliant complexion.</p>

<p>“Skipping over the gentleman on
her left, because on this first morning
I found nothing to remark upon, I come
to my <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>, with her kindly and
companionable expression (I am sure I
shall like her;) and having mentioned
our present stock of ladies on the opposite
side, the lower part of the table is
made up of gentlemen, one of whom
presides at that end. On my side of the
table, the upper seat is generally reserved
for a visitor. I am happy to
find in the whole party nothing distressing
to look at: no lameness, no appearance
of skin diseases, no sign-post
or label to proclaim an aliment, no sore
eyes, no ‘<em>eyesore</em>;’ nothing, in short,
worse than an occasional pallid or invalid
character, like my own; and I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
told that all who have any palpable or
disagreeable infirmity, are treated as
out-door patients, which wholesome regulation
gives full play to the proverbially
high spirits of hydropathists,
who almost immediately jump from a
state of dejection and perverse brooding
over their ailments, to a joyous anticipation
of good, even on the first day of
initiation into the treatment. The appetite,
too, is always ready for the
simple, wholesome meal. Nobody ever
enjoyed a well-earned breakfast more
than I on this morning.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The gentleman “of a dissenting
expression of countenance,” of whom
we desiderate a drawing, seems the
only bit of shade in this bright scene.
We have quoted, without abridgment,
the description of the company at the
table, as not unimportant, alongside
of the hilarity of hydropathists, who
jump from grave to gay, “even on the
first day of initiation into the treatment.”
Mr Lane will understand that
we do not at all doubt his account of
his illness. He must not quarrel with
us for remarking that simple fare, regular
diet, agreeable society, lots of
laughing and talking, bathing and
shampooing, bracing exercise, and enchanting
natural prospects, appear admirably
adapted to reinvigorate the
invalids to whom we have been introduced.
It would surprise us to be informed
that the process had any where
failed; and, as far as we can judge,
the prescription of the regular practitioner
in London would, without much
hesitation, be in similar cases—“Go
to Malvern for a month.” Shower-baths
and douches, too, may be had
in the Great Babylon, but not exactly
the refreshing concomitants so vividly
brought before us by Mr Lane.
Suppose we take a peep at a hydropathist’s
<span class="locked">dinner:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“At the head of the table, where the
Doctor presides, was the leg of mutton,
which, I believe, is every day’s head-dish.
I forget what Mrs Wilson dispensed,
but it was something savoury,
of fish. I saw veal cutlets—with bacon,
and a companion dish, maccaroni—with
gravy (a very delicate concoction):
potatoes, plain boiled, or mashed and
browned; spinach, and other green
vegetables. Then followed rice pudding,
tapioca, or some other farinacious
ditto, rhubarb tarts, &amp;c. So much for
what I have heard of the miserable diet
of water patients. The cooking of all
is perfection, and something beyond, in
Neddy’s opinion, for he eats fat!</p>

<p>“After dinner, the ladies did not
immediately retire, but made up groups
for conversation, both in the dining and
withdrawing room. A most happy arrangement
this, which admits the refreshing
influence of the society of ladies
in such a house.</p>

<p>“A drive had been proposed, and, by
the invitation of two of the ladies, I
joined the party.</p>

<p>“Through picturesque lanes, we went
to Madresfield Court, the seat of Lord
Beauchamp (Ned on the box.) We
saw the exquisite conservatories, the
grapes in succession houses, and pineries.
The principal furniture in this
house—carpets, tapestry, &amp;c.—were
placed exactly as they now appear,
more than fifty years ago. It is a very
romantic place, abounding in a great
variety of trees of magnificent growth.</p>

<p>“We returned soon after seven,
when I prepared to take my first <em>Sitz</em>
bath. It is not disagreeable, but very
odd, and exhibits the patient in by no
means an elegant or dignified attitude.</p>

<p>“For this bath it is not necessary to
undress, the coat only being taken off,
and the shirt gathered under the waistcoat,
which is buttoned upon it; and
when seated in the water, which rises
to the waist, a blanket is drawn round,
and over the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Having remained ten minutes in
this condition (Ned and I being on equal
terms, and laughing at each other), we
dried and rubbed ourselves with coarse
towels, and descended to supper with
excellent appetite.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Shall we alter or modify our observations,
in consequence of this extract?
Not pausing for a reply, we
wish to explain, that, in hydropathical
nomenclature, to be “half-packed” is to
be put to bed, with a wet towel placed
over you, extending from shoulders
to knees, and enveloped with all the
blankets, and a down-bed, with a
counterpane to tuck all in, and make
it air-tight. Here is complete “packing.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>May 15.</i>—It was not the experience
of the half packing that caused me to
awake early, but a certain dread in anticipation
of the <em>whole</em> wet sheet; and
at six the bath attendant appeared with
what seemed a coil of linen cable, and
a gigantic can of water, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
some comfort to <em>pretend</em> not to be in
the least degree apprehensive. I was
ordered out of bed, and all the clothes
taken off. Two blankets were then
spread upon the mattress, and half over
the pillow, and the wet sheet unfolded
and placed upon them.</p>

<p>“Having stretched my length upon it
and lying on my back, the man quickly
and most adroitly folded it—first on
one side and then on the other, and
closely round the neck, and the same
with the two blankets, by which time I
was <em>warm</em>, and sufficiently composed to
ask how the sheet was prepared of the
proper degree of dampness. [I was
told that being soaked well, it is held by
two persons—one at each end, and pulled
and twisted until water has ceased
to drop; or that it may be done by one
person putting it round the pump-handle,
or any similar thing, and holding
and twisting it at <em>both</em> ends.] Two more
doubled blankets were then put upon
me, and each in turn tucked most carefully
round the neck, and under me.
Upon this the down bed was placed, and
over all another sheet or counterpane
was secured at all sides and under the
chin, to complete this hermetical sealing.
By this time I was sure of being
fast asleep in five minutes, and only
anxious to see Ned as comfortable, for
he was regarding the operation with
silent horror. He, however, plucked
up, and before Bardon (the attendant)
had swathed him completely, favoured
me with his opinion, conveyed in accents
in which a slight tremor might be
detected, that ‘packing is jolly.’”</p>

<p>“What occurred during a full hour
after this operation neither man nor
boy were in a situation to depose, beyond
the fact that the sound, sweet,
soothing sleep which both enjoyed, was
a matter of surprise and delight, and
that one of them, who had the less excuse
for being so very youthful, was
detected by Mr Bardon, who came to
awake him, <em>smiling</em>, like a great fool, <em>at
nothing</em>, if not at the fancies which had
played about his slumbers. Of the <em>heat</em>
in which I found myself, I must remark,
that it is as distinct from perspiration,
as from the parched and throbbing glow
of fever. The pores are open, and the
warmth of the body is very soon communicated
to the wet sheet, until, as in
this my first experience of the luxury,
a breathing—steaming heat is engendered,
which fills the whole of the wrappers,
and is plentifully shown in the <em>smoking</em>
state which they exhibit as they are removed:
still it is not like a vapour bath.
I can never forget the calm, luxurious
ease in which I awoke on this morning,
and looked forward with pleasure to the
daily repetition of what had been quoted
to me, by the uninitiated, with disgust
and shuddering.</p>

<p>“The softness and delicacy of the skin
under the operation is very remarkable,
and to the touch, clearly marks the difference
between a state of perspiration
or of fever.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We wish to be informed what there
is of novelty in all this procedure?
It is merely one way, out of many
ways, of taking a bath. The shepherds
on our hills, long before the
Water-Cure had local habitation or
name, were well aware, when their
hard but faithful service made the
heather their bed, that by dipping
their plaids in the stream, and wringing
them out, and then wrapping
them round their bodies, such heat
was generated as they could not
otherwise procure. Then the alternation
of hot bath and cold bath,
followed by dry-rubbing! The Russians
and the Turks are comparatively
beings of yesterday. But
what does a hydropathist undergo at
Malvern, for which Galen and Celsus
had not laid down plain and ample
directions? There is no apparatus
so intricate or so extensive—there is
nothing done by the hand or by
machinery at a hydropathical establishment,
which is not anticipated at
Pompeii, or was not familiar to those
eminent ancients whom we have
named. The economy of baths was
brought to more exquisite and copious
perfection by the Romans than it has
been since. Vice, luxury, gluttony,
fatigue, disease, caprice, indolence,
extravagant wealth, inordinate vanity,
imperial pomp, were all occupied
according to the impulse or the necessity
of the individual, or of cities and
provinces, to adorn with new contrivances,
or to supply the defects of
that essential furniture to the comfort
of the later Roman. The poets teem
with allusions to and descriptions of
the expedients used in ministering to
their effeminacy in the baths. The
medical writers have considered and
discussed the whole subject of baths
and bathing with a minuteness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
a comprehensiveness which leave nothing
to be learned from hydropathy
now-a-days. The Greeks wanted
only the enormous riches of Rome to
be cited as of tantamount authority.
Galen differs from Celsus in arranging
the order according to which different
baths should be taken; but the interval
between them may account for
all changes. Did it ever occur to
Galen that water was a panacea?
No; but many patients were under
his care, the counterparts of the sojourners
at Malvern; and that he
treated them much after the fashion
of Dr Wilson, we shall accord to the
later gentleman our belief. Rome,
in the reign of Commodus, was not
less likely than London to send forth
sufferers whose roses would renew
their bloom, and whose nerves would
regain their tension, at the bidding of
rustic breezes, lively chat, and methodical
discipline.</p>

<p>It has seldom been our happiness
to meet with a more astute lady of
her rank than the woman at the cottage
at St Anne’s, who replies to Mr
Lane, when he wonders at his power
to mount the steep hills,—“Indeed, so
do I, sir; but when I tell how the
Water-Cure patients get strength
to come up here, after a few days, and
how well they look, some gentlefolks
are <em>hard</em> enough to say the Doctor
<em>pays</em> me to say so.” We exonerate the
woman and the Doctor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>May 26.</i>—Packed, bathed, and out
as usual, but instantly turned <em>in</em> again.
It was raining after a fashion that, even
to me, seemed to promise no interval or
alleviation.</p>

<p>“We turned into the dining room,
and, pushing the seats of the chairs under
the table, we made a clear space for
walking round the room. Our dining-room
is forty feet long; and, after a
minute’s discussion as to our intended
route, it was settled that we should go
(by the watch) to the spring beyond the
Wyche. I opened the windows, and
Ned arranged water bottle and tumblers
on the table, undertaking to announce
our arrival at the several springs. He
had marked the distances by the time
occupied, and so we started, and having
walked from end to end of the room—and
round the table ten minutes, Ned
called that we were at the Turnpike,
and we stopped to drink. We then
passed on, doing all sorts of small talk
with a friend who had joined us, until
we got to the Wyche and to the Willow
Spring; then we drank again, and just
having started, we met, at the turn of
the road, Mr Townley; who came suddenly
upon us, and joined our party
cheerfully. There were frequent over-takings
of each other, and at the corners
of the paths we contended for the
sharp angles, and carried out the rules
of the road by passing on the proper
side.</p>

<p>“Mr Townley walked as well as the
best of us, and was a delightful walking
companion; full of anecdote, of solid information,
and a quiet dry humour all
his own; but we could not inoculate
him with a love for Malvern. Enumerating
the varied attractions of the place,
I unluckily wound up with the charming
<em>drives</em>; when he admitted that it is ‘a
delightful place <em>to get away from</em>.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>A rebel in the camp! What is to
come next? Why, a revelation that
the Water-Cure system at Malvern is
so old that the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>May 27.</i>—Packed, bathed, and out
as usual. Surely the variable nature of
our climate is a source of constant,
never-failing interest. Here is a glorious
morning, following a day that
seemed to give no hope of a change.
Walked with Sterling and Ned to the
Holy Well at Malvern Wells, then
mounting the hills to the Beacon.</p>

<p>“The work published by Dr Card
tells of extraordinary cures effected by
the water of the Holy Well. The monks
of old used to wrap in cloths steeped in
this water, persons afflicted with leprosy
or other eruptions; and (as the <i>Guide</i>
quotes) ‘make them lie in bed, and even
<em>sleep</em>, with the wet cloths on the diseased
parts.’</p>

<p>“Why, here was an instinctive use
of the ‘Wet Sheet Packing’ of very
ancient date; but <em>not</em> (as the monks perhaps
deemed) miraculous.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The monks have unexpectedly got
Mr Lane into a scrape. Their treatment
of their patients is in all respects
the same as the hydropathic treatment.
But what is science in hydropathy is
instinct in the priesthood. It is the
most singular instance of instinct ever
recorded. A controversy has long
raged as to the precise approximation
of animal instinct to human reason.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
The line of demarcation between the
instinct of the monk and the reason of
the hydropathic doctor is so faint and
slender that nobody, except a “packed”
Malvern jury, with Mr Lane as foreman,
could be audacious enough to
hint its existence. So the worthy and
intelligent monks not only knew how
to select a charming residence, but
practised the Water-Cure several hundred
years ago! What becomes of the
apt comparison between the “common
fate of new revelations,” as illustrated
in the hostility of doctors which
nearly ruined the great Harvey, and
the disbelief of sensible people in the
virtue of hydropathy? Hydropathy, in
our view of it, is nothing new; but
when it is demonstrated that at Malvern
itself it existed in former ages,
its want of success cannot with consistency
be attributed to its novelty.
The originality of the system, altogether,
is on a par with the following
branch of <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>May 31.</i>—“At five o’clock in walked
the executioner, who was to initiate me
into the <span class="smcap smaller">SWEATING</span> process. There was
nothing awful in the commencement.
Two dry blankets were spread upon the
mattress, and I was enveloped in them, <em>as</em>
in the wet sheet, being well and closely
tucked in round the neck, and the head
raised on two pillows; then came my
old friend, the down bed, and a counterpane,
as before. I need not sketch this,
as it is precisely like the wet sheet packing
in appearance.</p>

<p>“Not so in <em>luxury</em>. At first I felt
very comfortable, but in ten minutes the
irritation of the blanket was disagreeable,
and endurance was my only resource—<em>thought</em>
upon other subjects out
of the question. In half an hour, I
wondered <em>when</em> it would begin to act.
At six, in came Bardon, to give me water
to drink. Another hour—and I was
getting into a state. I had for ten
minutes followed Bardon’s directions,
by slightly moving my hands and legs,
and the profuse perspiration was a relief;
besides, I knew that I should be
soon <em>fit</em> to be <em>bathed</em>, and what a tenfold
treat! He gave me more water, and
then it broke out! In a quarter of an
hour more he returned, and I stepped,
in that condition, into the cold bath,
Bardon using more water on my head
and shoulders than usual—more rubbing
and sponging, and afterwards more
vigorous <em>dry</em> rubbing. I was more than
pink, and hastened to get out, and compare
notes with Sterling. We went to
the Wyche. This process is very startling.
The drinking water is to keep
quiet the action of the heart. To plunge
into cold water after <em>exercise</em> has induced
perspiration might be fatal, but
this quiescent, passive state, involves
no danger of any kind.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To recur to the Roman bath is superfluous.
The curious will find in
Celsus all they have read in these extracts,
and much more than is “dream’d
of in your hydropathy, Horatio.” The
ingenuous narrative of Mr Lane is useful.
The preposterous pretensions of
the Water-Cure are visible and palpable.
There may be no harm in Malvern,
so long as the patients with
whom Mr Lane makes us acquainted
resort to it; although, conscientiously,
we coincide with Mr
Townley in his opinion that it must be
“a delightful place to get away from.”
We do not at all impugn Dr Wilson’s
medical skill, and we heartily admire
his tact. There are numbers of people
who, resisting and infringing the
orders of their medical advisers at
home, blindly obey the behests of the
physician at a watering-place. There
are many, also, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasés</i> and out of
sorts with the racket, the whirl, and
the glare of London life—or of what
is worse, a provincial burlesque of
London life—to whom the gentle influences
of the balmy country air waft
back the health which their riot had
almost frightened from its frail tenement.
These people visit such places
as Malvern, do what they are commanded
to do, spend their hours in
rational enjoyment, and go home—converts
to the Water-Cure. It is not
very just, but it is very common.</p>

<p>And now let us state distinctly what
we would really consider, and gladly
dignify, as “The Water-Cure.” For
although unable to recognise in water
an universal and infallible panacea for
all the ills that flesh is heir to, we can
yet bear a large testimony in its
favour, and send it out to service with
the highest character. It is our deliberate
and mature conviction that
the inhabitants of the Cumbraes and
the adjacent islands of Great Britain
and Ireland may, to their own infinite
advantage, fishify their flesh a great
deal more than they do at present.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
Our language does not embrace the
full scope of our recommendation;
because the minnow and the whale,
along with all the intermediate gradations
of the finny family, may probably
disclaim the reputation of
water-drinkers. Internally and externally,
according to the rational
views which we are about to explain,
we advocate the application of the
pellucid fountain and the crystal
stream. This is to touch, we are
quite aware, some of the most important
questions which can engage the
attention of the philanthropy and of
the legislature of this country. It is
to do so; and we hope to evince in
our remarks at once the fearlessness
and the moderation which become the
honest and the practical investigation
of matters affecting the moral and
the physical welfare of thousands of
human beings.</p>

<p>In lauding water as a beverage, it
is impossible to evade an expression
of opinion regarding the great movement
which is represented and embodied
in the existence and diffusion
of temperance societies over the length
and breadth of the land. Whatever
words can be selected of most emphatic
significance, we are willing to
adopt in general approbation of that
movement. We single out here no
individuals for encomium, and refuse
to decorate with a preference any particular
fraternity or society. Taking,
as our limits necessarily oblige us to
take, a broad survey of the principle,
and the results of the principle disclosed
by experience, we cheerfully
pronounce both to be positively and
undeniably good. Observe, we say
temperance. Total abstinence is a
different thing altogether—an extreme
which may warrant and cover abuses
as bad as drunkenness itself. No
spectacle is more ludicrous than a
procession of Tee-totallers. If total
abstinence is a virtue hard to win, and
accessible only to an inconsiderable
minority, the pharisaical ostentation
of its vain-glory is not calculated to
attract or conciliate the overwhelming
majority who feel unable to soar to
its sublimity. If, on the other hand,
total abstinence is a virtue of such
easy acquisition as to imply no sacrifice
either in grasping or holding it,
surely banners need not wave, nor
bagpipes grunt, to celebrate such humble
and ordinary merits. The Stoics,
in declaring pain to be no evil, unconsciously
proclaimed that there was
no fortitude in suffering. The citizens
of Edinburgh who live guiltless of
larceny do not perambulate the
streets once a-year in holiday attire
to the cadence of martial music, for
the purpose of being pointed out to
the marvelling on-looker as men who
never picked a pocket or broke
into a larder. Total abstinence is
not an end which common sense
acknowledges to be attainable. In
peculiar circumstances it may be
that a sagacious and strong mind,
determined to rescue masses of his
countrymen from a degrading and
destructive bondage, may begin by
tearing them violently and completely
asunder from their former pernicious
habits. His ultimate hopes, however,
do not rest on the permanency of this
revulsion, but on the foundation which
even its temporary supremacy enables
him to plant in the understanding
and in the heart, for finally establishing
better inclinations, wiser purposes,
a detestation of excess, and a love of
moderation. National temperance
will be the triumphant realisation of
his aspirations; and as we believe
national temperance to be practicable,
so we believe it to be desirable, on the
lowest and most selfish, as well as on
the loftiest and purest grounds. As
politicians, we are satisfied that
the temperance of the people is an
auxiliary in securing, assisting, and
facilitating good government, little
inferior to many of those invaluable
institutions for which Britons are ready
to shed their life-blood. The national
tranquillity, energy, industry, and
affluence, ought to be the aggregate of
the contentment, enterprise, diligence,
and wealth of each individual. Any
thing, therefore, which will convince
a man that sobriety makes a happier
fireside than heretofore, gives to him
at all hours of the day a cooler head
and a steadier hand than he used to
have, and leaves at sunset a shilling
in the purse which he could never
find there during the reckless season of
his dissipation, is not merely a direct
benefit to the individual, but a substantive
addition to the resources and
strength of the community. We wish
to preach no ascetic doctrines, nor to
curtail the enjoyment of life of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
the least of its fair proportions. Over-fasting
and over-feasting are alike
repugnant to our ideas. What we
delight to see is, that hundreds and
tens of hundreds, voluntarily turning
off from a road which leads invariably
to misery, poverty, and crime, are
now treading a more salubrious path,
where, as they proceed, an unreproving
conscience and domestic happiness
must cheer them with their blessings,
and, in all probability, worldly
prosperity will reward them with its
comforts. The first part, then, of our
“Water-Cure” is temperance—by
which we do not mean either that
water is the only fluid which mortals
shall imbibe, or that water,
even if so exclusively imbibed, is
the elixir of life. We mean a
general recognition in the conduct
of life, that while intemperance is
senseless, brutish, dangerous, and
guilty, temperance on the contrary—without
stinting enjoyment, or balking
mirth, or fettering the freest exhilaration
of his nature—secures to
man at all times, whether of relaxation
or of toil, the healthful development
of his faculties, and would, in
this our own country, prodigious as
its industry is, and magnificent as its
achievements have been, redeem a
quantity of time and means wasted,
which, rightly employed and exerted,
might elevate the social security and
harmony, the political and commercial
ascendancy, the public and the
private affluence, of the British empire
above the visionary splendours
of an Utopian commonwealth. Thus
far we</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fetch our precepts from the Cynick tub,”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">without fear of being accused of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Praising the lean and sallow Abstinence.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The external application of our
“Water-Cure” sends us plump over
head and ears into as many fathoms
as you please. In the middle of the
multitudinous sea, or under the even-down
deluge of a shower-bath, we
are equally at home and at ease. No
misgivings of any kind restrict our
exhortation to wash and to bathe.
Medical advice is so precious a thing
that we are anxious to enhance its
value by its rarity. Nothing will
effect this purpose so certainly as the
habitude of constant and sensitive
cleanliness among rich and poor,
young and old. What ought to be
the cheapest, and what is the most
thorough instrument of cleanliness, is
an abundance, an overflowing superabundance,
of water. Before judging
our neighbours, we may begin by
looking into matters at home. Is it
possible that the metropolis of Scotland,
at any season of any year, shall
be in such a condition from want of
water as to exclaim in its agony,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, my offence is rank!—it smells to heaven?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Is it possible that during certain summer
months, in more than one year,
of which the recollection does not dry
up so readily as the city-reservoir,
water could with difficulty be procured
here for love or money? And is
this the place, where the ordinary
supply fails sometimes to meet the
ordinary demand, in which it was
gravely and enthusiastically proposed
to erect spacious baths for the working
classes? It is infinitely discreditable
that such occurrences should
have ever distressed us; but, looking
forward both to what the people
themselves are attempting, and to
what the government intends to do, the
necessity is apparent for an immense
and immediate alteration and improvement
in the supply of water to all
large and densely-populated towns.
The squabbles of companies cannot
be permitted to banish health and
breed fever. Extensive sanatory measures
introduced into a city of which
the water-pipes might be dry during
the dog-days, would be a repetition of
the monkey’s exhibition of the beauties
of the magic-lantern, forgetting to
light the lamp. The husky voice of
the public, adust with thirst, shall not
be wholly inaudible. The procrastinations
of juntos cannot much longer
be accumulated with the vicissitudes
of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>When the scheme for the erection
of baths for the working classes was
first promulgated here, we individually
subscribed our pittance, and predicted
its failure—and for this reason: The
plan could not stand by itself. To
make a labourer, at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
day’s or the week’s work, as clean and
fresh as soap and hot-water, with all
appliances and means to boot, could
make him, and send him to encounter
in his own dwelling and vicinity the
filth and the odours of a pig-stye, was
not a very feasible proposition. But
personal purification would induce
household tidiness. It might do so,
if ventilation and drainage and space
were all at his command, and within
his regulation. If they were not, in
what a hopeless contest he engaged!
Invisible demons, on whose invulnerable
crests all his blows fell harmlessly,
whose subtlety no precaution
on his part could exclude, and to
whose potency his own lustrations
only made his senses more acute,
would speedily quench his new-born
ardour, and probably seduce him back
to the persuasion, that for one in his
position the truth lay in the proverb—“The
clartier the cosier.” We must
also give him the benefit of those data
which political economists never refuse
to any body—a prolific wife and
numerous progeny. A clean house of
one room, open to the incursions and
excursions of seven or eight children,
whose playground is the Cowgate, or,
let it be the shores—that is, the common
sewers—of the Water of Leith,
is a tolerably desperate speculation.
Thither, however, our operative, radiant
from his abstersion, is doomed
to repair, that he may be affronted by
the muddy embraces of his infants,
and oppressed by the fragrance of his
home. The project of the baths, simply
as such, although excellent in its
spirit, and true in its tendency, could
not, we repeat our belief, have been
productive, as an isolated effort, of
material or ending benefit. Much
must go hand in hand, and step by
step, with it. Ventilation and drainage,
and more ample elbow-room,
are indispensible to carry us forward
successfully in the momentous progress
on which we are, earnestly, we
hope, entering towards the amelioration
of the people. Nor shall we
hesitate to affirm, that no system of
education can be satisfactory or complete,
which shall not at least endeavour
to provide some means for extricating
the offspring of the lower
classes in their tender years, when the
superintendence of father or mother
is almost an impossibility for a great
portion of the day, out of the causeway
and the dunghill, and if not absolutely
to put them in the way of
good, at all events effectually to keep
them out of the way of harm.</p>

<p>Then it is that we shall clamour
for water with indomitable pertinacity.
We shall demand it every where—in
private houses, in public baths, and
in fountains in our streets and squares.
There can be no excuse for withholding
it. Nature has not been niggardly
in her distribution among the neighbouring
hills of this simple and invaluable
gift. When sums of money
which stagger the most gaping credulity
are revealed so near our thresholds,
and demonstrated to be so
readily available for useful purposes,
it is neither presumptuous nor irrational
to expect that a few driblets
from the still swelling hoard may be
dedicated to operations which, in
combination with other extraordinary
conceptions and performances, may
crown the present century as more
wonderful than any age, or all the
ages, which it has succeeded. Great
Britain, within a little span of time,
has launched into an ocean of hazardous
experiments. The voyage is
more perilous, we think, than many
anticipate; but if it be otherwise, and
our forebodings are dissipated by
steady sunshine and fine weather; if
a new commercial policy shall furnish
more sustenance than we require,
without any detriment to native industry;
if a grand system of education
is destined to fortify public intelligence,
without weakening public
virtue; and if the physical condition
of all ranks shall be ultimately so
comfortable as to enable them to enjoy
their good dinners and their good
books, let us hope to hear, with our
own ears, the people with one acclaim
cry out—“We are well-fed, well-educated,”
and “Our hands are
clean!”</p>
